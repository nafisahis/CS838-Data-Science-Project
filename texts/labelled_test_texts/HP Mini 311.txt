Talkthere's been a lot of it ever since Nvidia announced that its Ion chipset would allow netbooks to run full 1080p movie clips, speed up video transcoding, and play 3D games. Lenovo and Samsung announced they would carry Ion-based netbooks, but both companies have yet to produce one for retail. Leave it to HP to take the initiative with the first Ion-based netbook on the market. The <p>HP Mini 311</> ($470 direct) runs on an Intel Atom processor, but everything around it belongs to Nvidia, including the heralded Ion graphics. A slight catch, though: The 311 runs on the Ion LE version, where the "LE" is equivalent to an entry-level version of the Ion platform. Although 720p and 1080i (24 frames per second [fps]) movie clips played to perfection, 1080p (24fps) clips suffered some lag. And despite offering better frame rates than Intel-based graphics, most of our high-end games were virtually unplayable on the Mini 311. Furthermore, it's a little more expensive than your average netbook and its 5 hours of battery life fell well short of the 7-8 hour scores amassed by Intel-only netbooks. If your budget can only afford a netbook, but you still want to play and edit high definition videos, this is the model I would recommend. Otherwise, stick with the <p>Toshiba mini NB205</>. Design The Mini 311 is what you would call an oversized netbook. It's about the same size as the <p>ASUS EeePC 1101HA</>, <p>Acer Aspire One (A0751h)</>, and <p>Gateway LT3103u</> in that they all have 11.6-inch widescreens. At 3.3 pounds, it's the heaviest among its peers, although the differences are small. The Mini 311 is the prettiest though, as HP's signature imprints against a white background is delightful to look at. A black version is also available, though darker colors are usually a magnet for fingerprints and smudges. Alternatively, the Toshiba NB205 and <p>HP Mini 5101</> use textures and metals, respectively, to enhance their looks, as well as repel unsightly smudges. The Mini 311 is a bigger netbook than the Toshiba NB205 because it houses a bigger screen. Although 11.6-inch widescreens are building momentum in the netbook space, they, along with a 1,366-by-768 resolution, are still tough finds. Most 10-inch netbooks default to a lower, 1,024-by-768 resolution. Likewise, the Asus 1101HA, <p>Gateway LT3103u</>, and Acer A0751h have matching screen sizes and resolutions. They're not even the biggest netbooks screens: Both the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad S12</> and <p>Samsung NC20 (21GBK)</> use 12-inch widescreens and 1,280-by-800 resolutions. Features I would have been more impressed with the keyboard had it been full size. Both the <p>Gateway LT3103u</> and Acer A0751h come with full size keyboards. Nevertheless, the 92% keyboard delivered a very good typing experience despite being slightly undersized. The touchpad is unusually wide and responsive, while the mouse buttons made these loud clicking noises. The benefit of choosing Nvidia over an Intel platform is that HDMI-Out is supported natively, something you don't normally find in Atom-based netbooks. It can also drive 1,920-by-1,080 resolutions to a larger display. I tested the HDMI-Out with the Samsung LN55A950 LED display and it worked perfectly. Thanks to its size, the Mini 311 can also carry a VGA-Out, three USB ports, Nvidia's Ethernet, and a 5-in-1card reader. The 160GB hard drive is pretty much standard in netbooks these days. And there are plenty of wireless options as well, including Bluetooth, 802.11n Wi-Fi (most netbooks have just 802.11g), and embedded mobile broadband, which will cost you an extra $125. Performance What makes the Mini 311 special is that it runs an Nvidia chipset instead of the Intel chipset found on every other netbook on the market. It still needs a CPU, though. The 1.66GHz Intel Atom N280 is a commonly used netbook processor, which means in terms of raw horsepower, the Mini 311 isn't that far ahead of other netbooks. Video encoding tests finished in 4 minutes 54 seconds, which is about as fast the Toshiba NB205 (4:45) and Lenovo S12 (4:40). It's the fastest among its 11-inch peers, since the Asus 1101HA and Acer A0751h run on a more inferior Atom Z520 processor and the the <p>Gateway LT3103u</> opts for an AMD low voltage CPU. The Mini 311 has more oomph when it comes to graphics performance. The ION LE is basically a stripped down version of the Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics chipsetthe same chipset found in the <p>Apple MacBook Air</> (Nvidia 9400GM). The "LE" portion means that support for Direct X is downgraded from 10 to 9. Its scores on 3DMark06, which I ran just to see what the performance would be, were in the same ball park as the MacBook Air and annihilated those of its netbook counterparts. Despite these 3D benchmark scores, the combination of the Atom processor and lack of a Direct X 10-capable graphics chipset crippled games like World in Conflict and Crysisboth of these games lagged to the point where they were unplayable. Games like World of Warcraft and Mini Ninjas, which have lower graphics requirements, were lag-free and absolutely playable. The gravy was supposed to be in high definition playback. I tested several HD movie clips on the 311, as well as playing them to the Samsung LN55A950 HDTV. It handled all of my 720p and 1080i (24 fps) clips with great color accuracy, good picture detail, and they didn't suffer from any lag. When playing 1080p (24fps) movie clips in H264 and WMV formats, however, there was noticeable lag. Let's just say it wasn't a smooth experience. From time to time, I could hear the fans running, presumably to dissipate the extra heat emitted by the graphics chipset. And even though its 6-cell, 53Wh battery is roughly the same capacity as the one found in the Toshiba NB205 and HP 5101, its score of 5 hours 29 minutes on MobileMark 2007 is about 2 to 3 hours less than that of the competition. Still, more than 5 hours of battery life is very respectable. By netbook standards, the <p>HP Mini 311</> is reasonably priced and offers features most netbooks lack. You're paying a small premium for a netbook that has an HDMI port and can drive 1080p resolutions to a bigger display. Though it didn't deliver on 1080p playback, it handled 720p and 1080i videos better than netbooks with Intel-based graphics. For those who were hoping to make a gaming netbook out of this, think again. High-end 3D games are still best played on full-fledged laptops.
