Most computer-savvy people are into their third, fourth, or fifth generation of home PC, and many of them still like the tower form factor for its easy expandability and economical upgradability. The <p>Dell Inspiron i620-228NBK</> ($479.99 list at Best Buy) is an excellent replacement for that old PC that's way to slow to use these days. It's got the multicore processor that's a must, plus 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi so you don't have to put it in the same room as your cable modem. This Dell has the power to out-muscle systems that cost over a hundred dollars more, and that's a lot for this price range. Basically, this is one of the best desktop computers you can get for under $500. Design and Features The <p>Dell Inspiron i620-228NBK</> won't win any beauty contests. About its most defining characteristic is its blandness: It's pretty much a plain-looking black metal tower, which means it will work just about anywhere, but there are a few embellishments for design's sake. The top of the system has an indented tray so you can rest cameras, smartphones, or external hard drives and reasonably expect them to stay there. The system doesn't have any top-mounted USB ports, which are present on competitors like the <p>Gateway DX4860-UB21P</> ($599.99 list, 3.5 stars). But you should be able to string a device's USB cable to one of the six USB 2.0 ports in the back, or one of the two USB 2.0 ports in the front. The front USB ports, a media card reader, and headphone and microphone jacks are hidden under a swing-down door, so they aren't exposed when not in use. In addition to the USB ports, the back of the system has a VGA port; more audio jacks; Ethernet; and an HDMI port (formerly a rare inclusion on systems in this price range) for carrying video and audio signals to large-screen monitors and HDTV sets. The interior of the i620-228NBK has a good deal of expansion space, which is the main reason you'd buy a tower over a mini PC or all-in-one desktop. You can install an extra hard drive, optical drive, PCI Express (PCIe) x16 graphics card, and up to two PCIe x1 cards. One PCie x1 slot is occupied by the 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi card, which is notable for its ability to use the less-crowded 5GHz bands for 802.11a and n; this is a huge plus in a system that costs less than $500. Similar systems like the <p>Asus Essentio CM1730-05</> ($569.99 list, 3 stars) lack this crucial wireless connection. The i620-228NBK's 300-watt power supply should be enough for a midlevel video card. If there's any drawback to the Dell's interior, it's that the hard drive and its metal mounting framework amplify the sounds of the hard drive accessing your data; the Asus CM1730-05 had the exact same model 1TB hard drive and its hard drive was silent. You won't hear anything if you're blasting music on headphones, but the drive noises are definitely audible in a quiet room. Your computing environment will dictate if that's a deal breaker or not. Dell preloads the i620-228NBK with its Dell Stage software, which is also found on touch-screen systems like the <p>Dell Inspiron One 23</>05-4429MSL ($849.99 list, 3.5 stars). Dell Stage now has cloud functionality, so you can automatically upload photos, music, and other content to Dell's servers. You get 2GB of storage free, and can purchase additional capacity at rates of 5GB for $19.99 per year, 25GB for $49.99 per year, and 100GB for $149.99 per year. The Dell Stage interface floats on your screen like a launcher for apps, and you can close it if you think it's distracting. Other preinstalled software includes Microsoft Office 2010 Starter and Skype. The system comes with a very short 30-day trial subscription to McAfee's Internet Security; because any PC user can download a 30-day trial for free on Norton's website, all PC Makers should put at least 12-15 months on new PCs to protect their users from online threats. (More time would probably reduce calls to technical support phone lines as well.) Best Buy also has an extended warranty program, which offers an extra year of protection beyond the one-year warranty of most system manufacturers. There are two plans in this program. The standard plan ($119.99) covers the system against normal wear and tear, power surge damage, and includes a "No Lemon" guarantee in which Best Buy will simply replace the computer if it requires more than four repairs during the coverage period. Best Buy's advanced plan ($219.99) offers all this, and also covers the system against accidental damage from drops and spills. Other special offers, like discounts on printers, software, and tech support plans, are available with any new consumer PC purchased through Best Buy, and can be found online or in stores. Performance Surprising for an entry-level PC, the Dell i620-228NBK's performance on our multimedia benchmark tests was very good. The Dell took 1 minute 42 seconds to complete the Handbrake video encoding test and 3:55 to finish the Photoshop CS5 test. Compare that with the Asus CM1730-05, which needed 2:03 for Handbrake and 4:47 for CS5, and the <p>HP Pavilion p7-1010</> ($599.99 list, 3 stars), which needed 2:02 for Handbrake and 4:59 for CS5. While you won't be starting a graphics design business on one of these systems, the Dell is the one that will help you get your video and photo tasks (like quick crops, photo filters, and post-processing like red eye reduction) done more quickly. You'll need to install a discrete video card to play anything more complicated than Web-based 3D games or World of Warcraft at a low quality setting, as all three of these systems return slideshow-like scores on the Crysis test. So why should you buy the Dell i620-228NBK? It's got many of the features that cost thousands of dollars more only several years ago, such as 4GB of memory, 1TB hard drive, built-in 802.11 Wi-Fi. Other sub-$750 systems we've looked at recently, like the HP p7-1074 and Asus CM1730-05, come with more system memory, but have the same-size hard drive and won't necessarily be better performers. Our last budget desktop Editors' Choice was the <p>Lenovo IdeaCentre K330-11691AU</> ($599.99 list, 4 stars), which had the same Core i3-2100 processor and 1TB hard drive with even more memory (8GB), but the i620-228NBK costs $120 less and has a Wi-Fi card. This Dell is one of the least expensive systems out there today, and it is just about all you need, especially if it's your third, fourth, or fifth PC, and intended to replace one you bought years ago. Therefore, the Dell i620-228NBK is our new Editors' Choice for entry-level desktop PCs.
