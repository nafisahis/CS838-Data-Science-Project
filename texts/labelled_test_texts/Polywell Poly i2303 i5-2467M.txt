No matter how fondly you regard alliteration, the phrase "fast and furious" typically doesn't spring to mind when you think of nettops. And rightfully so혰they're the "netbook" of desktop computing: compact, low-powered, and generally less expensive. The <p>Polywell Poly i2303 i5-2467M</> certainly adheres to this formula: It's incredibly tiny (check); it uses 40W of operating power (so far, so good); and it costs $899 (crickets). Yes, you read that correctly. The Polywell Poly i2303 ($899 direct) costs nearly twice as much as most nettops, made all the more egregious by the fact that it doesn't come with an optical drive. Heck, it doesn't even come with a keyboard or mouse. Worse yet, the two internal drives are set up in a way that makes the system almost unusable. Unsurprisingly, the phrase "fast and furious" still didn't come to mind after testing the Poly i2303. A better dual-drive configuration and a more reasonable price tag would have made the Poly i2303 a nettop suitable for either business or personal use. As it were, though, the good is seriously outweighed by the bad. Design and Features Aesthetically, the i2303 is a study in minimalism. Whether you choose the black or silver finish, the sleek metallic chassis is elegant in its understated simplicity. The end result is a streamlined body adorned with nothing other than the air vents on the sides of the unit. Though you can feel air shooting from these vents, the Poly i2303 runs virtually silent aside from an initial burst of noise from the cooling fan after you turn it on or wake it from sleep mode. This, along with its diminutive size, ensures that the i2303 will neither be seen nor heard if placed behind a large screen혰something of a shame because it looks terrific. The only departure from the metallic motif is a detachable plastic antenna for Wi-Fi in the back of the i2303. Just like the Sony Playstation 2 , the 8.7-inch tall Poly i2303 comes with a metallic stand so it can be positioned upright. Alternatively, the stand can be unscrewed and the system laid horizontally, giving it the look of a mini-cable box. At a mere 1.55 inches wide and 6.6 inches deep, the Poly i2303 is about as slim as a router. The svelte design is attributable to the absence of an optical drive as well as an inability to accommodate any sort of internal expansion, two shortcomings that aren't necessarily worth the trade-off. In our test system, the 8 GB of DDR 3 RAM filled up both DIMM slots. Moreover, there are no free PCI slots. Fortunately, a solid amount of ports at least allow for external expansion. The rear of the system includes four USB 2.0 ports, an e-SATA port that can accommodate speedy hard drives, HDMI out and a speaker jack. The front of the system sports the system's sole USB 3.0 port, audio and microphone jacks, and a media card slot. Next to the price, the most frustrating aspect of the i2303 is the inexplicable manner in which the two internal drives are set up. The system comes equipped with a 750 GB hard drive as well as a primary 20 GB solid-state drive (SSD) that allows the i2303 to boot up briskly. In theory, this sounds great, but in practice there was only 1 GB of free space actually available on the solid state drive. In order to make the system function properly for testing purposes, I had to constantly transfer data between the drives. This proved enormously problematic, as I couldn't boot most programs from the larger drive without compromising the extremely limited space on the SSD. Ironically, the relative absence of bloatware on the system made this issue all the more difficult; I'd begrudgingly be willing to delete extraneous programs to free up some room on the SSD, but the majority of its space was inhabited by essential drivers and software that would have been imprudent to delete. It should be obvious that 20 GB is simply too small for a C: drive, regardless of whether it's intended for business or personal use. Ultimately, the Poly i2303 was almost unusable, as the nonexistent drive space had the effect of strapping it into a virtual straitjacket. Performance Because of its maddening C: drive and the attendant problems it manifested, I initially couldn't install most of our benchmark tests on the Poly i2303. When I was actually able to test the i2303, though, the power of its dual-core 1.6 GHz Intel i5 processor and integrated 1 GB Nvidia Geforce 520 GPU quickly became apparent as it handily outperformed all comparable nettops in its class. Although it's not touted as a gaming system, the i2303 certainly held its own in that area. Crysis ran at a respectable 27 frames per second (fps) in medium-quality settings. And even though it struggled to pump out 3 fps on very high quality settings, no other nettop in its class was nearly as agile in running Crysis in either setting, including the pair of Editors' Choice-winning nettops: the <p>Acer Revo RL100-UR20P</> ($569.99 direct, 4 stars) and <p>Lenovo IdeaCentre Q150</> ($399, 4 stars). The i2303 also outperformed the other nettops when it came to multimedia creation. It completed our Handbrake video encoding test in an impressive 2 minutes 35 seconds. The only other nettop that came even remotely close was the Acer RL100, and even with its dual-core AMD Athlon II K325 processor it still took over twice as much time (5:43). The <p>Giada MiniPC A50</> ($449 street, 3.5 stars) took nearly three times longer (9:18), while the IdeaCentre took 12:31, and the <p>Acer Veriton VN281G-UA425W</> ($399 list, 2 stars) took an even longer at 23 minutes 28 seconds. The i2303 similarly dominated our Cinebench R11.5 test, with its score of 1.94, nearly three to four times faster than the Acer Revo (0.69), Lenovo IdeaCentre (0.52), and the MiniPC A50 (0.64). Despite their lower benchmark scores, all of these nettops provide more value for your dollar than the i2303, especially those that come with accessories. The Acer Revo RL100 still has the most bang for your buck혰it costs over $200 less, and it comes with a keyboard, mouse, and even a Blu-ray player. And while neither the Levono IdeaCentre Q150 nor the Acer Veriton come with a Blu-ray player, both run for half the price of the i2313 while coming with a keyboard and mouse. Only the <p>Giada MiniPC A50</> comes without an optical drive, mouse and keyboard, but at only $399, its omissions are far more forgivable. Ultimately, the Polywell i2303 i5-2467M isn't a terrible nettop. A lower price tag and sensible dual-drive configuration would have gone a long way toward amplifying its positive aspects. If you're looking to get the most bang for your buck, you'd be better off with the Editors' Choice Acer Revo RL100혰 in addition to costing over $200 less than the i2303, it comes with a keyboard, mouse, and even a Blu-ray player. The Poly i2303 isn't a total failure, but its glaring (and sometimes inexplicable) flaws keep it from achieving nettop nirvana.
