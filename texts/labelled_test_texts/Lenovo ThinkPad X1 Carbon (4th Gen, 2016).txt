With its slick and slim design, Lenovo's fourth-gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon (starts at $1,142.10; $1,533.60 as tested) is the kind of business laptop you'll gladly show off around the office. It retains the features that we like, including a thin, yet sturdy carbon fiber and magnesium construction, a good selection of I/O ports, and that excellent ThinkPad keyboard. On top of this, it's faster, has a higher-resolution screen, packs a longer-lasting battery, and is a half pound lighter than last year's model. While the latest laptop lacks a touch screen, it does ring up for $300 less. That puts it into the same price range as the reigning champ <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T450s</>, and it offers enough to make it our latest Editors' Choice for business laptops. Design and Features The laptop's carbon fiber and magnesium body is thin, strong, and exceptionally light at 0.65 by 13.1 by 9.0 inches (HWD) and a svelte 2.54 pounds. That's thinner and lighter than last year's touch-enabled X1 Carbon, though the depth and width are about the same. It's also lighter (but larger) than ultraportable competitors like the <p>HP EliteBook Folio 1020</> and the <p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch</>. Granted, the latter two systems have smaller screens. There's no flex in any panel, which makes the laptop feel luxurious and durable. The keyboard is spill-resistant, and the system's hardy frame has been certified for several MIL-STD 801G tests, including high humidity, low temperature, high temperature, blowing sand, vibration, mechanical shock, high altitude, and temperature shock. It's also been subjected to and passed Lenovo's tests for durability, drop tests, and electrostatic shock. Surviving a daily train commute should be a breeze. The 14-inch screen has a 2,560 by 1,440 (WQHD+) resolution, with far more room than the 1080p HD you get with most mainstream laptops. The extra space can come in handy for viewing large spreadsheets or wide Web layouts. Vibrant colors and details in photos and high-resolution videos look gorgeous on the IPS display, even with the anti-glare coating. In contrast, the HP EliteBook 745 G3 has a much duller display. Viewing angles on The Carbon X1 are excellent; this is a good thing since the screen rotates to 180 degrees, so you can lie the laptop flat on your work surface. This makes the laptop ideal for showing small presentations, say, in a board meeting. In more than 15 years of reviewing laptops, the backlit keyboard is among the best I've felt. Each chiclet-style key is full-sized, has a solid feel and key travel that's just right. They're shaped with a slight curve that makes the prospect of a long typing session much more attractive than using if you were using the comparatively sparse keyboard on the Apple MacBook or the flappy add-on keyboard case on the <p>Microsoft Surface Pro 4</>. While it seems like a 1990s throwback, the eraser-shaped Lenovo TrackPoint controller is a feature that some business users can't live without. It can be used concurrently with, or in place of, the one-piece TrackPad below the keyboard. Two physical mouse buttons and a scroll button sit between the TrackPad and the space bar. There's a biometric fingerprint reader on the right side of the palm rest that dovetails with the system's TPM chip and enterprise-class security. Connectivity is excellent here. On the left side, you'll find the system's Power jack, OneLink+ docking port, a mini DisplayPort, and a USB 3.0 port with always-on charging capabilities. On the right, there's a headset jack, two more USB 3.0 ports, and an HDMI port. Surprisingly, for such a slim system, there's a hidden micro SD card slot and a SIM card slot for the optional 4G LTE modem on the back of the laptop. Our review unit did not have the modem installed. OneLink+ may be a problem for veteran ThinkPad owners that currently use OneLink docks, since you'll need an adapter cable to use the new docking port. One notable omission here is Ethernet connectivity, which your business may use to address speed and security concerns. 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 are present for wireless connections. You get 8GB of system memory and a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) for storage. The drive comes with a few pre-loaded apps like Dolby Audio, McAfee LiveSafe, and links to download Microsoft Office, but for the most part, the system is bloatware-free. The battery is sealed, so you can't swap it out for a freshly charged pack on the road, but since battery life is excellent, that really doesn't matter. Lenovo covers the X1 Carbon with a standard three-year warranty. Performance A sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6300U processor with Intel HD Graphics 520 powers the laptop. It requires a fan for cooling, but the system is still very thin for a business laptop. The system's performance on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test (2,733 points) was above average. The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T450s</> and the Core i7-powered <p>Acer TravelMate P645-SG-79QV</> edged out the X1 Carbon. However, the system was faster than the 2015 version of the X1 Carbon Touch, <p>Dell Latitude 14 5000 Series (E5450)</>, and HP EliteBook 745 G3. Multimedia performance is a lot stronger than you'd assume for a lightweight laptop. It completed the Handbrake test in a class-leading 2 minutes, 27 seconds and topped the CineBench scores at 298 points. Its time at the Photoshop test (4:29) was just behind the leading Acer Travelmate P645 (4:05), ThinkPad 450s (4:10), and last year's X1 Carbon Touch (4:14). In any case, you'll be able to easily complete light to moderate photo and video editing on the X1 Carbon. As usual for a business laptop, 3D performance is passable for a system with integrated graphics, but you shouldn't be playing games on your work PC. The system truly qualifies for all-day computing, lasting 10 hours and 13 minutes on our battery rundown test. That's pretty astounding, since last year's model stopped just shy of nine hours, which is longer than most of the rest of the competition. Only the Apple MacBook (11:37) and MacBook Air (17:36) last longer. While it's about $100 more expensive than the ThinkPad 450s, the latest <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</> Carbon has a higher-resolution 14-inch screen and a sublime keyboard, it's a pound lighter, lasts over ten hours, and is covered by a longer warranty. The ThinkPad 450s offers slightly better connectivity (Ethernet and VGA), a touch screen, and a removable battery pack. Even still, the X1 Carbon offers more than enough to earn our latest Editors' Choice award for business laptops.
