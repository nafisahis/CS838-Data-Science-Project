If you're in the market for a multimedia powerhouse with a preset data "safety net," then the <p>Dell XPS 410</> ($1,913 direct, $2,313 with 20-inch widescreen LCD monitor) is worth a long, hard look. The XPS 410 is the Intel Core 2 Duo-powered update to Dell's midrange/high-end desktops. Its predecessor, the XPS 400, was a Pentium D-powered system. The XPS 410 updates the entire line to Core 2 Duo power and runs cooler and quieter. My test system has an Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 CPU, high-end nVidia GeForce 7600GS graphics, and two 320GB hard drives in which to pack your digital life. There are also opportunities to upgrade the system, including one free PCIe x1 slot, one PCIe x4 slot, one regular PCI slot, and a pair of free memory slots. This high-powered hardware combines to achieve performance numbers on some tests that are twice those of the XPS 400 I reviewed last year. The XPS 410 also has dual TV tuners to record all of your TV shows with MCE's DVR. Dual tuners will let you record on one channel while watching another one live, or record from two channels at once. Just about the only nit I can pick is the lack of an ATSC/HDTV tuner. All this and at $1,000 less than its predecessor? Where do I sign up? The <p>Dell XPS 410</> uses the same BTX-based metal case as the XPS 400, and that's a good thing. The gray plastic clamshell cases that housed older (maybe 2002-2005) Dimensions were innovative for their time, but were ultimately annoying to open and tinker with. The new white and black metal cases are a lot easier to open and add components to. I would like to see one or two more drive bays, though. All of the XPS 410's optical bays, internal drive bays, and external drive bays are fully loaded with components. That means that if you want to add something newsay, a better graphics card or a 1TB driveyou'll have to remove an existing component to install the new one. Of course, most people don't tinker with their systems after buying them, so this "con" can be overlooked by most consumers. In any case, the chassis is easy to move around in, and you can remove most user-serviceable components without a screwdriver. The XPS 410 comes with Dell's two-part DataSafe system, which is set to automatically back up the system out of the box. First, Dell uses Symantec's Ghost software to automatically back up settings, applications, service packs, drivers, and yes, your important data files. Like other backup systems, Ghost can save you if you accidentally delete a program or documentyou can just restore it from one of the backups. The second partand where DataSafe differs from just using GhostDell uses RAID 1 mirroring to back up your hard drive automatically. This means that if your primary hard drive ever physically dies (from overuse, a defective platter, or overheating, for example), the mirror drive takes over, and not only can you keep working, playing, or surfing, but you'll also retain access to your data. You'll still need to replace the defective drive, but in the meantime you can keep using the system without having to install a new drive and go through a data-recovery procedure with phone-support techs. (Speaking of which, I've heard reports of people having problems with Dell's XPS tech-support lines, which are a large contributor to the XPS line's higher price and marketing differentiation. I'll be monitoring the discussion forums on PCMag and Gearlog to hear from those of you who already have XPS systems. Maybe we can get to the bottom of this together.) Thanks to its 2.4-GHz Core 2 Duo E6600 CPU, the XPS 410 achieves numbers on some of our performance tests that leave last year's XPS 400 (which had a faster-clocked 3.2-GHz Pentium D 840 processor) in the dust. Both systems debuted with high-end graphics: the XPS 400 with an nVidia GeForce 6800 card (near the top of the line at the time of the XPS 400's release), and the XPS 410 with a GeForce 7900GS. What a difference one year can make. The XPS 410 almost doubles the XPS 400's 3DMark05 score at a 1,024-by-768 resolution. Same goes for the Doom 3 score: The XPS 410 can run it almost perfectly smoothly (54 to 55 frames per second) at 1,600-by-1,200, unlike the XPS 400 with the GeForce 6800 (21 to 23 fps). Likewise, the XPS 410 doubles the XPS 400's score on the Splinter Cell test at 1,600-by-1,200, but it does start to peter out at 2,560-by-1,600. This is a mainstream PC that can handle high-end gaming experiences without resorting to dual graphics cards. The XPS 410 is also a photo and video powerhouse. Even with a RAID 1 system slowing things down a bit (the difference is hardly noticeable, but it's one of the reasons that not everyone uses RAID 1), the XPS 410 blows the XPS 400 out of the water. The XPS 410 earned an overall SYSmark 2004 SE score of 331 points48 percent faster than the XPS 400 (which scored 224). In the Windows Media Encoder test, the XPS 410 finished our standard test file in 5 minutes 15 seconds; the XPS 400 was a lot slower, at 8:34. That's pretty amazing, considering that other mainstream Media Center systems, like the Sony RC310G came in at 8 minutes 35 seconds, while an older "high-end multimedia" system, the <p>Cerise Serene X2 4800</> could manage to break only 6.5 minutes (at 6:24). The XPS 410 also runs the Adobe Photoshop CS2 test at 1:10blazing for a mainstream system. The <p>Dell XPS 410</>'s powerful processor, data safety net, and class-leading graphics win it our Editors' Choice award for a high-end/mainstream multimedia system. The jury is still out on whether the XPS tech support line will be able to rise above some documented missteps, but the XPS 410 itself is a solid multimedia power system. Plus, it's more likely to be readily available than the scarce, boutique-style XPS 700. It's a good choice for anyone with $2,000 burning a hole in his pocket.
