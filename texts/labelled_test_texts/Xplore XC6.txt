Rugged tablets may not be big sellers to the average PC shopper, but for the soldier in a sandstorm, the miner in a shaft, or an EMT at the scene of an accident, the need for a durable tablet has never been greater. Until now, however, rugged tablets lagged behind regular business systems, thanks to older, less capable components. With the <p>Xplore XC6</> Rugged Tablet ($5,299, as tested), however, you get the power of current Intel processors, the full feature set of Windows 8.1, and still get the durability that rugged devices have offered all along. Design Measuring 1.6 by 11.2 by 8.3 inches (HWD), the <p>Xplore XC6</> is definitely one of the chunkier rugged tablets on the market. Tipping the scales at 5.4 pounds, it's a model of the old school, unlike the svelte <p>Getac F110 </>(3.11 pounds) or the 2.5-pound <p>Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1</>. The <p>Xplore XC6</> rugged tablet has the same chassis seen on the <p>Xplore Wildcat 5 M2</>, with layered magnesium-alloy construction, chunky rubber bumpers on each corner, and a sturdy handle attached to one side with a tough nylon strap. The tablet is sealed inside and out to withstand dust, sand, water, and nastier fluids like brake fluid. There are sealed port covers and a self-contained cooling system that offers ventilation without reducing the impervious protection. Internal shock absorbers provide further protection to the delicate components inside. All told, the XC6 is rated to withstand full submersion for 30 minutes in up to a metter (3.28 feet) of water, protection against blowing sand and dust, blowing rain, salt fog spray, thermal shock, extremes in altitude, shock and vibration, contamination by fluids, and even resistance to fungal growth and solar radiation. The tablet's 10.5-inch display offers 1,024-by-768 resolution, which isn't spectacular, but it is sufficient for 720p content, and it's more forgivable at this size. It's made for use in full sunlight, with adjustable brightness up to 1,300 nits, and can also be dialed down to 2 or 3 nits to reduce unwanted screen glow in low-light environments. Xplore has also added a resistive multitouch touch screen. Instead of capacitive touch sensors, which don't work well with gloves or a standard stylus, the resistive sensor technology works in all manner of conditions, while still offering support for Windows 8.1 gestures and 10-finger tracking. An included stylus offers fine cursor control, comes with a fray-resistant nylon tether, and can be stored in the tablet. To keep the tether out of the way (preventing dangerous snags), the rubber bumpers around the corners also have a shallow channel around which the tether cord can be looped. Rugged tablets aren't known for their high-quality audio, but the XC6 has capable built-in stereo speakers and a noise-canceling microphone, offering sound quality that's above par and should cover all your needs for video conferencing. On the front of the tablet is a 720p webcam for just this purpose. A 5-megapixel camera on the backside can be used to snap photos and shoot video in the field. The cameras are both pretty capableÂ—the fixed-focus webcam did fine in tests with Google Hangouts and Skype, while the rear-facing camera offers pretty good autofocus, but slightly muted colors, and the contrast wasn't great in bright sunlight. Features On the bottom edge of the tablet is a docking connector, for use with the many dock and stand accessories available for XC6. Aside from the docking port, the tablet's ports are protected by two sealed covers. Behind one you'll find a power connector, two USB 3.0 ports, and a headset jack. Behind the other is a Gigabit Ethernet port and HDMI video output. The system is available with an array of networking choices, with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 included as standard, and options that add LTE and GPS (2-Meter or sub-meter GPS is available). The XC6 is also ready for enterprise integration, with a half-dozen business-friendly features available, like a fingerprint reader for simple security, Intel vPro and TPM 1.2, Computrace device tracking, and integrated CAC Smart Card reader. A warm-swappable battery makes it easier to keep the tablet running day and night when there's no room for downtime, requiring a few moments in sleep mode to switch a battery instead of a full shutdown and boot. The 80.7-watt, lithium-ion battery itself has a built-in power level indicator. Press a button on any battery not currently in use, and you'll see an LED status indicator telling you how much charge the battery has. Next to the battery is a removable cartridge that holds two 128GB solid-state drives (SSD), combined in RAID 0. The removable drive makes it easy to swap out the drives on a system, a must for maintenance in the field and for securing sensitive data when handing off a device. The XC6 is available with either Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 operating systems, with an array of optional features and accessories tailored to the many industrial, military, and public service uses for which it's built. Xplore Technologies covers the XC6 with a three-year warranty, and optional four- and five-year extended protection plans are available. Performance The <p>Xplore XC6</> has a 1.7GHz Intel Core i7-4650U dual-core processor and 8GB of RAM. Combined with the 256GB of the dual-SSD storage, the performance was some of the best we've seen from a rugged tablet. In PCMark 7, the XC6 scored 5,152 points, ahead of both the <p>Getac F110 </>(4,600 points) and Panasonic FZ-G1 (4,472 points). That same performance led the XC6 to solid scores in Cinebench (2.72 points) and Handbrake (1 minute 19 seconds). The speed is relative, however, as it took 10 minutes 8 seconds to grind its way through our Photoshop test. This means that it will offer great performance in basic communication and productivity tasks, but processor-intensive work, like photo editing, will be pretty slow. With an integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000, the graphics performance was so-so, at 1,662 points in 3DMark11. Again, heavy-duty computing tasks and rendering aren't really what this tablet is built for, and even at the lower 1,024-by-768 resolution dictated by the display, the performance isn't spectacular. While the performance had some expected limitations, the battery life was excellent, lasting 7 hours 56 minutes on our battery rundown test on a single charge. Combine this endurance with the ability to swap batteries in and out as needed, and the XC6 tablet can run for as long as you need, with only brief pauses to switch out the warm-swappable batteries. Conclusion The <p>Xplore XC6</> is a definite step up from its predecessor, the <p>Xplore Wildcat 5 M2</>, with significantly improved processing performance and battery life, while still retaining all of the ultra-rugged construction that rendered the Wildcat so impervious to harm. But while the XC6 improves on almost every aspect of the previous iteration, the performance isn't so different from the Getac FZ-110 and the <p>Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1</>, and it's nearly twice as expensive and double the size. If the <p>Xplore XC6</> offers the features you're after in a rugged tablet, it's easy to recommend, but overall, it's not a big enough improvement to supplant our current Editors' Choice, the <p>Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1</>, which has a great, high-res screen, Wacom digitizer, and modular option, and is half the price.
