After more than three years of perfecting its imprinting designmade up of patterns beneath a glossy plastic layerHP decided that its premium brand deserved something more in line with today's trends. The Envy line, as you may recall, was a synonymous with Voodoo PCa custom PC builder that HP acquired several years ago. The Envy moniker reemerges under new direction, starting with the <p>HP Envy 13</> ($1,899 direct, as tested)a sleek 13-inch ultraportable with switchable graphics, excellent battery options, and a fantastic resolution. HP is also firm about leaving the past behind, recasting the internal optical drive, an Ethernet port, and VGA-Out as external attachments. Only an unenviable price and couple of minor feature miscues, stand in the way of true greatness. Design The Envy 13 is a specimen of beauty; comparisons to the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch</> and the <p>Dell Adamo</> 13 are inescapable. At 3.7 pounds, it's lighter than the MacBook Pro 13-inch (4.5 lbs) and the <p>Acer Aspire 3935</> (4.1 lbs) because it omits the optical drive (the latter two have internal DVD drives). The Envy 13 is about the same thickness as the MacBook Pro 13-inch, measuring 12.6 by 8.7 by-0.9 inches (HWD). The Adamo 13 is thinner than both of them, measuring only 0.65 inches thick. HP sells an optional 6-cell battery slice ($100) that spans the entire area of the base and fits flush with it. Consequently, it also makes it stand taller than the MacBook Pro13-inch and brings its weight up to 5.1 pounds. The Envy 13 is crafted from aluminum and magnesium bonded materials, while the MacBook Pro does it from a thick slab of aluminum. Its metals are anodized several layers deep, so the Envy 13 is not only sleek, but durable, scratch-resistant, and lightweight as well. Apple and HP aren't the only ultraportable manufacturers that use metals, though. The <p>ASUS UL30A-A1</> and <p>Acer Aspire Timeline AS3810T (6415)</> have also experimented with aluminum metals in their frames, though only in the top cover; the Envy 13 uses metals throughout the entire chassis, which drives up costs. The designs are limitless as well: The Envy 13 sports a brownish tint and can be permanently etched with lasers in different patternsjust like HP's current Pavilion line designs. Features The luxurious theme extends to its interior. Its 13.1-inch widescreen is one of the brightest in the industry, rated at 400 Nits (cd/m2), and covered in glass, too, which gives it the same clean look as that of the MacBook Pro 13-inch. Its 1,600-by-900 resolution is the highest and most eye-popping thus far on a 13-inch screen, outclassing that of the MacBook Pro 13-inch (1,280-by-800), Acer 3935 (1,280-by-800), and <p>ASUS UL30A-A1</> (1,366-by-768). It matches the resolution of the <p>Dell Studio 14z</>great for multimedia tasks, but not so much for reading text, as higher resolutions tend to make fonts look tinier on a small screen. The full size keyboard is styled in the same way as that of the MacBook Pro 13-inchtiled, with plenty of spacing between each key. The Envy 13 lacks a back-lit option, though, which is inexcusable for a luxury line. In comparison, the MacBook Pro 13-inch and Studio 14z include illuminated keyboards for dark-lit rooms. The embedded mouse buttons also take their styling cues from Apple's design, as they're disguised by one huge touchpad. They're slightly too resistant for my tastes, but otherwise responded well to various clicking commands. The touchpad, like the one found in the MacBook Pro, supports two-finger gestures, which often times got in the way of navigating. You can turn these gestures off in the system's Control Panel. In terms of features, the Envy 13 takes a minimalist approach and that isn't always a good thing. This laptop is not intended for legacy users, since it doesn't come with an internal optical drive, a VGA-port, or an Ethernet jack. I think ridding these features from the system is acceptable, plus all of them are included in this configuration as external USB attachments. Unfortunately, though, you have only two USB ports to choose from. Unlike the Studio 14z, the Envy 13 includes a media card reader, which is still a vital feature for digital camera owners. An ExpressCard slot is not available, though, which would've been handy for adding an ExpressCard docking solution or 3G wireless, since both of these aren't sold as optionsand there are only two USB ports available. Taking the place of VGA-Out is an HDMI port, which is the video-out standard most laptops are leaning toward. In contrast, the Studio 14z includes both DisplayPort and HDMI technologies. The 250GB hard drive is a 1.8-inch spindle, but spins at 5400rpm. Performance Performance-wise, HP makes some interesting moves. Rather than use a standard voltage Intel processor, like the one found in the MacBook Pro 13-inch and Acer 3935, the Envy 13 opts for a low voltage onethe 2.13GHz Intel Core 2 Duo L9600. It's not a Consumer Ultra Low Voltage (CULV) processor either, like the one found in the <p>ASUS UL30A-A1</> and <p>MSI X340 (021US)</>, so it didn't choke on resource-intensive tasks. More intriguing is that the Envy 13 paired a low-voltage processor with switchable graphics, which means that it uses both discrete (ATI Mobility Radeon 4330) and integrated (Intel) graphics in the same frame. Switching to integrated graphics is as simple as pulling the AC adapter, as this type of graphics is more beneficial to prolonging battery life. Plugged in, you can reap the 3D benefits of the ATI chipset. (You can, of course, override this default setting by right-clicking on the main Windows screen and choosing Switchable Graphics from the drop-down menu). In addition, the Envy 13 comes with 3GB of DDR3 memory, with the option of going to 5GB. In performance tests, the Envy's low voltage processor performed extremely well against the standard voltage ones found in the MacBook Pro and the Acer 3935. It received top marks in video encoding tests, finishing in 1 minute, 3 seconds. In Cinebench R10 and Photoshop CS4 tests, the Envy 13 came in second behind the <p>Dell Studio 14z</>, which uses a faster processor. 3D benchmark tests heavily favored the Envy 13, as 3DMark06, Crysis, and World in Conflict scores surpassed those of the Studio 14z and MacBook Pro 13-inchboth of which use nVidia GeForce 9400M GT integrated platform. Against the rest of this group, which use Intel's integrated graphics onlythe Envy 13 simply dominated. A low-voltage processor is often used in favor of battery life. HP ensured that battery scores would eclipse all others by offering an optoinal 62Wh battery (6-cell) slice ($100) that fits on top of the standard 41Wh (4-cell) one. (Note: The review unit we received, which included the optional battery slice, costs $1,899. The laptop without the battery slice costs $1,799.) In total, you have two batteries, working in tandem, for outstanding battery life. The MacBook Pro 13-inch, on the other hand, uses a single (58Wh) non-removable battery that delivered 4 hours 44 minutes, according to MobileMark 2007. With two batteries, the Envy 13 broke new ground, scoring 14 hours 36 minutes (yes, you read that right) on MobileMark 2007. This beats the current record holder, the <p>ASUS UL30A-A1</> (10:27), by almost 4 hours. (Stay tuned for how the Envy 13 did with just the standard 4-cell battery). There were concessionssome of them will be sorely missedthat had to be made in order to achieve a desired thickness, but the <p>HP Envy 13</> makes amends by delivering outstanding battery life with two removable batteries, good graphics horsepower, and a luxurious all-metallic design. Is it worth spending the huge premium ($1,899) over the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch</> ($1,099) or <p>ASUS UL30A-A1</> ($775)? Probably not. But when prices come down, it's an ultraportable worth considering. That is, if you're ready to leave the past behind.
