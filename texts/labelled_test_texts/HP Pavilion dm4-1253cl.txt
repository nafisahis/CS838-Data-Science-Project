Among the growing list of accomplished, sleek-looking 14-inch laptops, the <p>HP Pavilion dm4-1253cl</> ($799.99 list, at Costco) is easily the lightest. Its 2.53 Intel Core i5-460M processor and 6GB of memory will please any prolific video or photo editor, and it's equipped with all the features that you would expect to find in a 14-inch laptop. But in order to make the dm4-1253cl the lightest and one of the most battery-efficient in its class of 14-inch laptops, it has do away with having a good graphics component, the kind that can be found in laptops like the <p>Samsung QX410-J01</> ($829.99 street, 4 stars), <p>Gateway ID49C13u</> ($849.99 street , 4 stars), and <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> ($867 street, 4.5 stars). Design HP, like countless others, is a big proponent of using aluminum in its laptop designs. The dm4-1253cl's lid is carved with a decorative pattern that extends into the palm rest area. The bronze tint that HP chose for its entire Pavilion line is a bit dull compared with the silvery tones found in the <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> and <p>Gateway ID49C13u</>. There's no disputing its road-appeal, as the dm4-1253cl's 4.4-pound frame is lighter than the <p>Samsung QX410-J01</> (5 lbs), <p>Asus U45JC-A1</> (4.7 lbs), and <p>Gateway ID49C13u</> (4.9 lbs). A 14-inch widescreen is where the line is drawn for a travel-worthy laptop. Anything larger will put you in desktop replacement laptop territory. There isn't much I can say about this particular screen, though, except that the resolution is capped at 1,366-by-768 and its brightness levels and viewing angles are in line with its peers. The full-size keyboard is very similar to the one found in the <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> and Samsung QX410; the chiclet-style keys are well-spaced and are raised to about the same height as the ones on the other two laptops. The dm4-1253cl's keyboard could use a backlit function, though, like the one found in the <p>Toshiba Satellite E205-S1980</> (3.5 stars). The "clickpad," on the other hand, could still use some refinement. Although it isn't as problematic as previous iterations (HP updated the clickpad with a new Synaptics driver), there were times when resting a second finger on the touchpad triggered an unexpected response. I really don't get what's so special about these all-in-one touchpads, which are used by the dm4-1253cl, <p>Samsung QX410-J01</>, and <p>Gateway ID49C13u</>. They would all be much better off had they used dedicated mouse buttons. Features The dm4-1253cl's feature set is pretty standard for a 14-inch laptop. It has built-in optical drive, although it's a tray-ejecting design, rather than the slot-loading drives of the Toshiba E205-S1980 and <p>Samsung QX410-J01</>. It comes with three USB ports, one of which doubles as eSATA port. Like every other laptop in this group, you'll also find HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, and a multimedia card reader. A fingerprint reader and a 7,200rpm hard drive are two features that aren't necessarily exclusive to the dm4-1253cl, but they can't be found in many 14-inch laptops. In this case, the speedy drive has a 500GB capacity. Costco also offers customers some added benefits. For example, whereas most vendors provide just a one-year warranty, Costco offers two years. It also offers Costco's Concierge Services, which a free service to Costco members who purchase electronics at the store. The service gives you access to technicians to walk you system setup, product use, and for troubleshooting. Lastly, the store accepts returns within 90 days. Performance The Intel Core i5-460M processor puts the dm4-1253cl in the same league as the <p>Samsung QX410-J01</> and <p>Gateway ID49C13u</>. It's one of the fastest dual-core processors available, breezing through many of our CPU-intensive tasks. And although no one will complain about the dm4-1253cl's 6GB of DDR3 memory, most tasks will only take advantage of 4GB. On Handbrake, a video transcoding and CPU-intensive test, the dm4-1253cl (2:48), finished ahead of every laptop in this group except for the <p>Gateway ID49C13u</> (2:44). The same can be said about Cinebench R11.5 (2.21), a CPU test that stresses both processor cores. We knew the dm4-1253cl would be a solid performer in CPU-related tasks, but did the 6GB of memory help performance? Not according to Adobe Photoshop CS5 scripts, a memory intensive task. Its 5 minute, 26 second score trailed the Toshiba E205-S1980 (4:56), the ID49C13u (4:55), and the QX410-J01 (4:56), proving that memory configurations beyond 4GB is not always beneficial. A good graphics component may not be an absolute necessity, but laptop owners like the idea of having one. You know, just in case. It's the reason why the Toshiba E205-S1980, Samsung QX410, <p>Gateway ID49C13u</>, and <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> have an Nvidia graphics chips, in the off-chance a 3D-intensive task presents itself. These dedicated graphics chips are arranged so that when they're not being used, they switch back to an integrated solution (Intel's), a technology Nvidia calls Optimus. Switching to an energy-efficient graphics chip prolongs battery life, as you'll see in battery tests. The dm4-1253cl, if you haven't already guessed, doesn't have a dedicated graphics chip to switch to. Hence, its 3DMark06, Crysis, and Lost Planet 2 results were either the lowest in the group or not reported because they were unable to run. Good battery life is arguably more important to travelers and commuters than raw horsepower, which is why the dm4-1253cl decided not to use a dedicated graphics chip. Its 55WH battery (6-cell) scored an impressive 6 hours 28 minutes in MobileMark 2007 tests, outlasting the <p>Gateway ID49C13u</> (5:52) and Toshiba E205-S1980 (5:29). Other laptops in this group chose to put in bigger batteries to offset the power-hungry graphics chip. The <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> (84WH) and <p>Samsung QX410-J01</> (60WH) did exactly that, and came away with excellent battery scores: 9:27 and 6:27, respectively. Six months ago, the <p>HP Pavilion dm4-1253cl</> would have been a sure-fire recommendation for serious travelers looking for a 14-inch laptop. In the interest of getting the most of the battery, this particular dm4 configuration opted to go with Intel's integrated graphics only. Meanwhile, other 14-inch laptops solved the graphics card predicament by using an automatic switching mechanism and putting in a bigger battery. The <p>Samsung QX410-J01</> is an excellent pick if you want a well-rounded mainstream laptop. If battery life is an absolute priority, the <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> not only gives you over 9 hours of it, but it's also the Editors' Choice in the mainstream category. Compare the <p>HP Pavilion dm4-1253cl</> with several other laptops side by side.
