The <p>Apple Mac mini </>has been an entry-level mainstay for the Apple faithful ever since its introduction in 2005. The exterior of the Mac mini (Nvidia GeForce 9400M) ($799 list) is the same 2 by 6.5 by 6.5 inches (HWD) that's been a mini hallmark for its entire existence. As usual, the interior has changed, this time significantly. These improvements, while keeping at the same price point, make it a compelling choice for the Windows-to-Mac switcher, as well as the mini fan. So what's new inside? For one the system has a 2GHz Core 2 Duo processor, identified in Windows as a "Core 2 Duo P7350" processor, running at 2.0 GHz. This is newer than the 2GHz C2D T7200 in the previous $799 Mac mini. The The new mini also has the same Nvidia GeForce 9400M chipset and graphics found in the new base iMac (Nvidia GeForce 9400M), MacBook 13-inch (Aluminum), and the updated MacBook Air. This common architecture helps Apple and its developers produce software and newer versions of OS X that will be more stable and robust. This mid-priced mini now has 2GB of memory standard (up from 1GB), a welcome addition. Last but not least, the internals now include an 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi adapter, which can give you faster 802.11n transfer speeds than 802.11g, if you have a draft-n router. The mini's 320GB hard drive (significantly larger than its predecessor's 120GB) is large enough to hold a household's iTunes library and fill up the largest iPods now available. The optical drive is still a DVD burning SuperDrive, but at least the $599 base mini also has a DVD burner instead of a DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drive. (No Macintosh has Blu-ray at this time.) There's still no keyboard or mouse included. The mini is in the same aluminum and white plastic chassis as ever, so unless you pick it up and look at the label on the bottom, or at the new back panel with the new connectors you wouldn't think it was any different. The mini now has FireWire 800 on the back instead of FireWire 400, an extra USB port (for a total of five). It also and now has two monitor ports (one mini DisplayPort, one mini DVI). The system support dual monitors, a first for such a small desktop, though Apple only includes an adapter for the Mini DVI port. The FireWire 800 port is significantly faster than the FireWire 400 port on the old mini. Most "quad-port" (USB, FireWire 400/800, eSATA) external hard drives will work on the mini without an adapter. All in all, there are some nice improvements here. Keep in mind, Apple's 24-inch LED-backlit Cinema Display is pretty much the only monitor out there that you can directly connect to the mini DisplayPort. If you want to connect it to a 30-inch display, you'll need an optional $99 DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter. (An optional DisplayPort to DVI adapter for smaller monitors is $29). That said, having two 24-inch monitors hooked up via Mini DisplayPort and DVI simultaneously gives you almost unheard-of screen real estate with desktop spanning, or alternately dual-display mirroring. The mini runs Mac OS X 10.5, now updated to 10.5.6. iLife '09 is new, and it recently got an Editor's Choice as one of the best home Photo/Video/Music packages. The mini is almost entirely devoid of crapware, just like all Macs. About the only thing that could be construed as crapware is an offer for a MobileMe 60-day trial subscription. It asks you to sign up during the initial setup process, but you can skip it and never see MobileMe again if you wish. The Mac mini's performance sets it apart from other small PCs, particularly those in the nettop and budget categories. Nettops can't even run most of our tests, including the 3D games, PCMark Vantage, Photoshop CS4, and 3DMark Vantage. The Mac mini runs rings round the older Mac mini. The new mini completes the Photoshop CS4 test in 3 minutes 50 seconds in Windows Vista and in 3:19 in Mac OS X. The old mini took an absolutely glacial 7:46 in Vista and 6:32 in OS X. The old mini only had 1GB of memory, contributing to crazy slow Photoshop scores. The systems were closer at the CineBench R10 test (which checks how fast the system can render a 3D image using the CPU alone): old mini (4,057) vs. new mini (4,372). The differences followed in the Windows Vista tests: The old mini couldn't even run any of our 3D game or 3D Vantage tests, but the new Mac mini was able to get a (low) 3,215 score on 3D Mark Vantage, and at least run Crysis (9 fps) and World in Conflict (11 fps). I'm sure you could play these games at real low resolution (800 x 600), but there's not much point in that. The new mini's gaming performance was better than the quad-core <p>Acer Aspire X1700-U3700A</> (2,523 at3D Mark Vantage, 7 fps atCrysis, 6 fps at WiC). However, the X1700 was faster at the multimedia tests like Windows Media Encoder: 1:16 for the X1700, 1:22 for the mini), and at Photoshop CS4 (2:16). Quad core does help multimedia performance, but the X1700 is over twice the size of the mini. Since the Mac mini has the same chipset and graphics as the $1,499 iMac (Nvidia GeForce 9400M), their 3D performance is similar, but the iMac is understandably faster at the multimedia tasks due to its faster 2.66GHz processor and 7,200 rpm hard drive. (The mini has a 5,400 rpm drive to save power and space.) Speaking of power, and moving on to green computing, the <p>Apple Mac mini </>(like all Macs now) has EPEAT Gold certification. (EPEAT is a consortium-based certification program that tracks products' environmental impact, Gold is the best score.) It meets the pre-criteria for Energy Star 5.0 (it's not ratified yet), and has smaller packaging (like the current iPods). It is miserly with its energy usage as well. The mini only uses 15W (measured) while idling, and a low 34W while running the CineBench benchmark test. This is the second lowest active score, after the 18W observed on the Asus Eee Box nettop. I'd take the mini as more useful, though, since the Eee Box can't run any of the other benchmark programs. The old mini was a little less frugal: 20W idle and 42W under load. Therefore the new Mac mini also earns our PCMag.com GreenTech Approved award. Green and compact, the <p>Apple Mac mini </>makes a good second PC in the house, or a great home base PC for someone with an iPod or iPhone. The Mac mini is a great upgrade to the last mini, but that's not surprising, since a year and a half has gone by since the last update in September 2007. If you're a mini fan with a 2005-2006 era Mac mini, now is the time to upgrade. There are faster quad-core powered PCs for less money (like the Acer Aspire X1700), but none of them are as compact as the Mac mini. I would've like to have seen another "wow factor" (lower price, Blu-ray, etc.) to give the mini a higher overall score, but the short story is that the Mac mini is a very good, green system for those that need basic computing needs and an excellent base station for the family's iPhones or iPods.
