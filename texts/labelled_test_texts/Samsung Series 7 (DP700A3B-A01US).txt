The Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) ($1,099 direct) is Samsung's sleek entry into the all-in-one desktop space. Beneath its slim frame, there's a fast Core i5 processor, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless options, and a huge 1TB hard drive. The included HDMI-in port adds further usability to this all-in-one, as a monitor when the internal components become outdated. Unfortunately, it suffers from a wobbly screen혰a major issue considering it's a touch-screen PC. Design and Features The Samsung Series 7 has a sleek grey aluminum and black plastic chassis. Its wide base balances the 23-inch widescreen monitor (1080p resolution) and holds the DVD+-RW drive and ports, leaving the monitor portion of the chassis slim. There's one USB 3.0 port and SD card slot on the right side of the base, and audio and mic jacks on the left. An Ethernet jack, four USB 2.0 ports, HDMI-in, and HDMI-out ports make up the back of the base. The HDMI-in port is must-have for all-in-ones in my opinion, as you can continue using the display portion of the system after the internal components have become obsolete by hooking it up to a game console or another PC. The Samsung Series 7 also features a few wireless features, like 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The hard drive is a spacious 1TB, which should be plenty of room to store family videos, pictures, and day-to-day files, with room to spare. The monitor is able to tilt back 90 degrees to lie flat, allowing you to use the touchscreen whether you're standing or sitting. The Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US)'s screen also utilizes a more advanced touch sensor that reacts like capacitive touch screens on tablets; whereas infrared touch sensors are less accurate, requiring the screen be surrounded by a raised bezel. But the seamless touch screen on the Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) makes it easier to touch points on the edges and corners. However, it's offset by the fact that the display has a tendency to wobble when you're touching it. Even a simple double tap to launch an application will cause the screen to shake. The Editors' Choice <p>HP TouchSmart 610-1150y</> ($1,199.99 list, 4.5 stars) and TouchSmart 520-1030 ($899.99 list, 3 stars), which features a "free standing" display similar to the Series 7, remain stable when you're utilizing their touchscreens. Samsung should have taken more care to make sure its touchscreen all-in-one was prepared for the pokes and prods of the touch market. Granted, you don't have to use the touchscreen; you can navigate the Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) by using the included wireless keyboard and mouse (which both hook up to the computer via one USB dongle). The Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) does come with some pre-installed software onboard. There are the extraneous programs such as Bing Bar, a short 30-day Norton anti-virus trial, Skype, and Wild Tangent games. Samsung has also thrown in its own suite of touch applications, and while not as advanced as HP's TouchSmart environment, it's not as anemic the Windows 7 Touch Suite. The Play Touch programs consist of a number of separate touch applications that you can launch from the start menu. These applications help provide a more touch-friendly environment to navigate within. There's a program for music, videos, social networks, an RSS reader, to-do lists, and more. Performance The Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) comes equipped with a 2.7GHz Intel Core i5-2390T processor and 8GB of memory혰a solid configuration for an all-in-one desktop. Its 2,753 point score in PCMark 7 was quite good혰better than competing systems, like the HP 610-1150y (2,667) and <p>Apple iMac 21.5-inch (Thunderbolt)</> ($1,199 list, 4.5 stars) (2,581). But in the remainder of our benchmark tests it lagged behind. It encoded a video in Handbrake in 1 minute 46 seconds, but the HP 610-1150y (1:29) and Apple iMac 21.5-inch (1:25) were several seconds ahead. The Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) ran through our Photoshop CS5 script in 3:48, which was faster than the HP 610-1150y (3:56), but the iMac 21.5-inch (3:29) was still the faster of the bunch. One notable performance discrepancy was in Cinebench R11.5, where the Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) scored 2.91 points, while the HP 610-1150y (4.47) and Apple iMac 21.5-inch (4.13) scored considerably higher. The Intel integrated graphics inside the Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) aren't built for gaming as demonstrated by its poor scores in our DirectX 10 Crysis (15.6fps) test, yielding unplayable results at Medium settings and 1,280-by-720 resolution. In comparison, the Apple iMac 21.5-inch is equipped with a 512MB AMD Radeon HD 6750M graphics chip, allowing it to play games like Crysis (70fps), and even DirectX 11 games like Lost Planet 2 (32fps) on Medium settings. The <p>Samsung Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US)</> is a beautiful all-in-one touch-screen PC that provides both a solid performance and a healthy feature set. And though for $100 more its Core i5 processor with buy you better performance than the Core i3 version of the Series 7, but you're still plagued with the same problem touch screen. The Series 7 (DP700A3B-A01US) is a touch PC, its wobbly screen is an issue that can't be overlooked. You're playing extra for an application that you assume will work properly, but it doesn't because the physical stand can't handle the poking and prodding necessary to utilize the touchscreen혰therefore the application is defective. The fact is for $100 more, there are better all-in-one PCs and better all-in-one touch screen PCs out there. The Apple iMac 21.5-inch is a much better performer for its $1,199 price tag, but it doesn't come with a touch screen. The Editors' Choice <p>HP TouchSmart 610-1150y</>, which features a more advanced touch operating system that overlays Windows 7 and a screen that doesn't wobble when poked, is another great option if touch is a must. Both offer better performance for the price, but you won't get the handy HDMI input. If that feature is a must-have, you might have to dig a little deeper for a touch-screen all-in-one like the Asus ET2400IGTS-B008E ($1,299.99 list, 4.5 stars).
