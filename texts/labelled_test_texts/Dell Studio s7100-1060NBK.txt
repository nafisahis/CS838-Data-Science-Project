The <p>Dell Studio s7100-1060NBK</> ($899.99 list) is a solid general-purpose desktop with strong overall performance. Available at Staples, the s7100-1060NBK's nearly-$900 price tag puts the system on the more-expensive end of the spectrum of the mostly budget-class desktops that Staples sells. But as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. The extra cash you'd plunk down for the s7100-1060NBK garners not only speedier performance, but also upgrade potential should your computing needs ever grow. The premium you'd pay now for the s7100-1060NBK might later be the difference between an inexpensive upgrade or needing to purchase a new system. The one thing the s7100-1060NBK won't give you is decent 3D gaming performancebut with the ability to upgrade the system, you could always pop in a more powerful graphics card. Design The s7100-1060NBK is a retail version of Dell's Studio XPS 7100 line, which itself is the little brother to Dell's more robustly configured Studio XPS 8100 and Studio XPS 9000 lines. The three models share very similar designs where their front panels are slightly angled and gently curved at the top, but the 7100 lacks the glossy finish and multi-colored chassis of the other two models, and is slightly smaller in stature. The s7100-1060NBK has a muted, gray matte-finish, or what Dell calls "Carbide Silver color with Titan Silver trim." A 19-in-1 media card-reader resides at the top of the front panel for easy access, and about midway down the front panel is a door that slides down to reveal 2 USB 2.0 slots and access to an unused 3.5-inch drive bay. On the top of the system is an indented media tray that also includes 2 more USB ports as well as microphone and headphones jacks. Around the back of the system are 4 more USB ports, an eSATA port, Gigabit Ethernet port, and a digital (SPDI/F) audio connector as well as six analog audio jacks for 7.1-channel audio support. There is also a covered DVI port that isn't meant to be used, because instead of using the system's integrated graphics, it has an ATI Radeon HD 5450 graphics card that sports DVI, HMDI, and VGA ports. A second add-in card provides 802.11n Wi-Fi support. Customers who buy this system from Staples can avail themselves of several services the retailer offers. This includes setting the new system up, data transfer from your old PC to your new one, software installation, and tech support and protection plans that range in price from $14.99 to $169.99. Features A label pasted on the front of the unit I looked at claims that the s7100-1060NBK is "highly expandable." I agree with the "expandable" part, but in my opinion the "highly" part is just hyperbole. You can add up to 2 more internal 3.5-inch drives (1 of which can be an external drive) and 1 more external 5.25-inch drive. But since the s7100-1060NBK comes with a spacious 1TB hard drive, it might be some time before you come close to filling it up and need to add another drive. A 1x PCI Express slot and a PCI slot remain unpopulated, but if you were to insert a card into the 1x PCI Express slot, you'd wind up blocking the fan on the graphics card and likely cause it to overheat and potentially fail. The s7100-1060NBK uses a 460-watt power supply that has two available 6-pin PCI Express power cableswhich means that you could upgrade the system to a much more powerful graphics card. But for a highly expandable system, you'd have to look at configurations more akin to the <p>Gateway FX6831-01</> ($1,300 list, ) or the ultra-high-end <p>Velocity Micro Raptor Z90</> ($5,499 direct, ). A Dell-branded laser mouse and multimedia keyboard come bundled with the s7100-1060NBK. The mouse is light and had a rather cheap feel to it. It also looked a bit out of place because it is white, while everything else was either black or dark gray. The black-colored keyboard is made of sturdier molded plastic and it includes a number of dedicated buttons for media playback and volume control, as well as hotkeys for launching applications, such as Internet Explorer, Windows Live Mail, or the AMD Fusion Media Explorer. The AMD Fusion Media Explorer is a handy digital media browser that not only offers easy access to your locally-store media, but also provides access to media from online sites, such as YourTube and Flickr. The system comes free of bloatware, and even includes a number of handy applications, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0, Roxio Easy CD & DVD Burning, and a 13-month subscription to McAfee Security Center. The usefulness of the s7100-1060NBK's bundled software is probably second only to the iLife suite that comes with all new iMacs, such as the <p>Apple iMac 21.5-inch (Core 2 Duo)</> ($1,199 list, ). Performance The s7100-1060NBK is powered by a 2.6GHz AMD Phenom II X6 1035T processor and 8GB of 1,333MHz DDR3 SDRAM. The processor's six cores and its relatively high clock speed translate to speedy raw-CPU performance, as shown by its CineBench R10 score of 15,086which is only 2% slower than what the quad-core, 2.93GHz Intel Core i7-870 in the <p>Polywell MiniBox P5500C</> ($1,850 direct, ) churned out. The system also fares pretty well in PCMark Vantagea good measure of a system's overall performance potentialcoming in a whopping 22% ahead of the <p>HP Pavilion Elite e9240f</> ($949.98 list, ), which is powered by a quad-core, 3GHz AMD Phenom X4 945. The s7100-1060NBK's performance on the multimedia tests is a bit of mixed bag, however; the CPU helped speed along in the Windows Media Encoder test, but it faltered a bit in the Photoshop CS4 test. Intel-based systems, such as the small-form-factor <p>Dell Inspiron 580s</> ($618 direct, )which is powered by a dual-core 2.93GHz Intel Core i3-530 CPUtend to perform better in the Photoshop test than AMD-based systems do. The 580s was about 7% faster in the Photoshop CS4 test. The s7100-1060NBK wouldn't be my first choice as a gaming rig. The Radeon HD5450 supplies a modicum of 3D acceleration, but it still falls behind what the older-model Radeon HD 4650 in the e9240f is capable of. The s7100-1060NBK mustered 25 frames per second (fps) in World in Conflict at 1,280 by 1,024 resolution with medium quality settingsthis is a playable frame ratebut only barely. At the same resolution and quality settings, the frame rate dropped down to an unplayable 17fps in Crysis. Typically, though, if you want a machine that can hold its own with today's 3D titles, you're going to have to pay more to get it. For instance, the <p>Gateway FX6831-01</> manages to pump out some pretty impressive 3D frame rates. There's a lot to like about the <p>Dell Studio s7100-1060NBK</>, from its elegant design to its strong application performance and room for future expansion. An 802.11n Wi-Fi adapter, a handful of useful apps, and no preinstalled bloatware are welcome features. Most users will find that the s7100-1060NBK more than meets their needs in terms of performance with everyday applications. But the s7100-1060NBK drops the ball performance-wise a little bit with Photoshop and a lot with 3D games. Our current EC in this category, the <p>HP Pavilion Elite HPE-140f</> ($1,029 list, ), is more powerful and better equipped with multimedia features (TV tuner, 802.11a/n 5GHz support, analog AV inputs).
