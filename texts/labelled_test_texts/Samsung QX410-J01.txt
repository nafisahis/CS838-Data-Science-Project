After only two years, Samsung has made its mark in the U.S as a prominent laptop manufacturer, squeezing prices like the best of them without compromising quality. Its latest, the <p>Samsung QX410-J01</> ($829.99 street), is built like a rock and looks like it costs a fortune. It's a cross between the <p>HP Envy 14-1110NR</> ($1,050 list, 4 stars) and <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> ($867 street, 4.5 stars), featuring an aluminum case and integrating cutting-edge features like a glass screen, the latest wireless technologies (Intel's WiDi and WiMax), and Nvidia's Optimus switchable graphics technology. The chintzy "clickpad" and non-removable battery, however, are things you rather not see in a laptop of this caliber. But aggressive pricing does have a way of making anyone turn a blind eye. Design The QX410-J01's brushed aluminum case is gun-metal gray, which helps conceal fingerprints and smudge marks. More importantly, the aluminum top is unyielding and doesn't flex when pressure is applied, unlike those of the <p>Gateway ID49C13u</> ($849.99 street, 4 stars) and <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</>. Its base is made of plastic, unlike other laptops whose chassis use aluminum all over, like the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz)</> ($1,199 direct, 4 stars), and the HP 14-1110NR. Despite the solid frame, the 5-pound QX410-J01 is marginally heavier than the U45Jc-A1 (4.7 lbs) and ID49C13u (4.9 lbs). The <p>HP Pavilion dm4-1160us</> ($849.98 list, 4 stars) (4.4 lbs) is the lightest 14-inch laptop in this group. Had it not been for a glass layer, the 14-inch widescreen would have been as generic as plastic screens of the <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</>, <p>Gateway ID49C13u</>, and HP dm4-1160us. The glass layer helps make the color in photos and videos really pop. It's a feature that's associated with premium laptops like the HP 14-1110NR and MacBook Pro 13-inch. The chiclet-style keyboard is full size and should receive few complaints from all kinds of typists. The "clickpad," however, is a different story. The QX410-J01 uses a "clicking touchpad," in which the mouse buttons are built into the touchpad itself. This approach works beautifully on Apple MacBooks, but so far no one else has gotten this right. HP tried it and failed with the HP 14-1110NR, and now Samsung is attempting the same. In the QX410-J01 the integrated pair of mouse buttons interfere with the touchpad's function, particularly if you surf with two fingersone for dragging, the other for clicking the mouse button. The touchpad multitouch gestures don't help. It's confusing the second finger as a command to pinch-to-zoom, enlarge, or scroll. When the gestures aren't recognized incorrectly, the cursor jumps from one end to the other. An easy work-around would be to navigate and click with a single finger. That, or disable the gestures in Elan's software within the Control Panel. Features The QX410-J01 has a mix bag of features; the most of impressive among them are Intel's Wireless Display (WiDi) and WiMax (4G wireless). If you're the type who does family slideshows or PowerPoint presentations on an HDTV, WiDi allows you to present them without attaching any cables. The concept is similar to wireless HDMI, and you will need to buy Netgear's Push2TV receiver ($100 option at Best Buy). The Netgear receiver has to be tethered to the HDTV at all times, though. WiMax ushers in a new generation of wireless connectivity. It spans an entire city, as opposed to WiFi, which covers a short-range. Throughput speeds range from 3-8Mbps, which is as fast as a home DSL package. Best of all, pricing plans are cheaper than many internet packages, and you don't have a dongle hanging off of a USB port. Aside from the wireless duo, the QX410 has a standard set of features. It has a tray-ejecting DVD burner, which is used frequently in 14-inch laptops. A slot-loading one is aesthetically pleasing and usually found in higher-end laptops like the MacBook Pro 13-inch and <p>HP Envy 14-1110NR</>. There are 3 USB ports and an HDMI port. The 640GB (5,400rpm) hard drive is as spacious as that of the Envy 14-1110NR (640GB, 7200rpm), but it doesn't spin as fast and isn't as quick with file transferring. The speakers are right above the keyboard and sound better than those of the U45Jc-A1 and ID49C13u. Performance The 2.53GHz Intel Core i5-460M and 4GB of DDR3 memory are the same components found in the Envy 14-1110NR and ID49C13u. It's one of the most powerful combinations on a 14-inch laptop, more powerful than that of the U45Jc-A1 and <p>Dell Inspiron 14R </>($820 direct, 3 stars), which both sport a Core i3 CPU and 4GB of memory. Naturally, speed tests that stress the CPU and memory were impressive on the QX410. Handbrake (2:54), a video encoding test, finished quicker than the U45Jc (3:02), but trailed the Envy 14-1110NR (2:46) and ID49C13u (2:44). Cinebench R11.5 (2.12) tests followed the same trend, which tells me that QX410's CPU wasn't running at full speed. Still, these two components in the QX410-J01 won't even break a sweat running the toughest tasks. It's a laptop fit for serious video and photo editors. The QX410 has something else in common with the U45JC-A1 and ID49C13u: They all reap the benefits of a midrange Nvidia chipset and a graphics switching technology called Optimus. Nvidia's Optimus technology automatically switches to integrated graphics when it the GPUY isn't needed. This saves a lot of power and extends battery life. Though the GeForce 310M is not as powerful as the GPUs found in the <p>HP Envy 14-1110NR</> (Radeon 5650) and ID49C13u (GeForce GT 330M), it can handle hardcore 3D games and the pick-of-the-litter in CAD software. It muscled through Crysis (56.5 fps) and Lost Planet 2 (37.4 fps) demos, albeit at half the rate of the ID49C13u and Envy 14-1110NR. Its gaming scores are similar to the U45Jc-A1, since both laptops run the same graphics chip. It's best to run 3D-intensive tests in medium settings, with the eye-candy cranked down Unlike most laptops on the market, the QX410 has a sealed, non-removeable battery. Ridding the latch-system made room for a big battery, but you can't bring an additional one or change the battery yourself if it dies. The 60WH battery lasted 6 hours 27 minutes, which is longer than the ID49C13u (5:52), dm4-1160us (5:30), and Envy 14-1110NR (4:20), though it was no match for the U45Jc-A1. With its 84Wh battery, the U45JC-A1 lasted 9 hours 27 minutes in our battery test. Despite the fierce competition in the 14-inch space, Samsung built a great system with the QX410-J01. In addition to its good looks, this mainstream laptop can trade performance punches with the best of themand it's priced to fly off the shelves. The moody "clickpad" and a non-removable battery aren't deal-breakers, but are worth looking at in person, at your local Best Buy, before committing to this laptop. If you want the near-perfect mainstream laptop, the <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> comes with a good navigating experience and a removable battery that will last over 9 hours.
