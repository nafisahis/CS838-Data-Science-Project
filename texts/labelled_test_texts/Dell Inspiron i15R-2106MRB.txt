The recently reviewed <p>Dell XPS 15</> ($1,115 direct, 4.5 stars) snagged an Editors' Choice for its collection of impressive components, multiple HD and wireless offerings, and polished feature set. While the <p>Dell Inspiron i15R-2106MRB</> ($849.99 list, at Costco) doesn't have the same best-in-breed components, it still offers a complete desktop replacement laptop that offers a similar experience, at a more reasonable price. Plus, Costco includes superb buyer protection and technical assistance for free. Design The Dell i15R-2106MRB is a good-looking laptop that incorporates several design elements from other lines of Dell laptops. The lid hinge is set forward, providing the same screen stability and wide opening screen angle found on the <p>Dell XPS 15</> and <p>Dell Inspiron 14R-1898MRB</> ($749 list, 4 stars). It uses the same faux-aluminum plastic lid as the Dell 14R-1898MRB, and used the real thing on the palm rest and around the keyboard. The chassis is primarily plastic, but the construction is solid with very little flex to it. This configuration also includes a Blu-ray optical drive, which is nice to see in any laptop under $1,000. The HDMI port allows simple connection to an HDTV or receiver, making this a viable addition to a budget home theater. On its own, it still provides a decent movie viewing experience for one or two people. The 15.6-inch, 1366 by 768 resolution screen can handle 720p video, and the built-in speakers are enhanced with SRS Premium Sound. It may not provide a top of the line listening experience like that of the monstrously large <p>Asus NX90JQ-A1</> ($2,533.26 street, 3.5 stars), but it also doesn't have the equally monstrous price tag. There is plenty of real estate for a full sized keyboard and a compact numeric pad. When it comes to keyboards many laptop manufacturers have moved toward the chiclet-style keyboard made popular by Apple. Dell has instead decided to stick with what works, opting for a traditional keyboard without the raised, isolated keys that are so in vogue right now. The touchpad is set just below the space bar has a matte finish and a smooth, silky texture that never distracts or disrupts the user experience. Its responsiveness is especially important since the i15R-2106MRB also has multitouch support. The buttons are also well built, clicking smoothly and quietly. Overall, the keyboard and mouse experience is almost identical to that of the <p>Dell XPS 15</>, though the touchpad is smaller on the i15R-2106MRB. The only design decision that may mar the i15R-2106MRB is the placement of some ports on the back of the machine. This is both a good and bad decision: Lesser used ports, like the VGA output, will do well tucked back out of sight. When a VGA connection is used, it renders the laptop stationary, and a rear-connected plug should cause no problems. However, putting two of the three USB connections on the back of the machine is a mistake. One only needs a mouse and a flash drive to be inconvenienced when connecting devices that are used every day. Features Placement issues aside, the <p>Dell Inspiron i15R-2106MRB</> has plenty of connections to offer. VGA and HDMI outputs are ideal for hooking up to an external display. The built-in card reader lets you pull photos and video off of several flash memory formats (SD, MMC, MS, and Pro). The three USB ports provide plenty of connections, though they aren't all conveniently placed. A combination USB 2.0/eSATA port provides superior speeds for connecting an external hard drive, but it may not be needed as the 640GB, 5,400rpm hard drive provides plenty of storage space. Dell also provides support for multitouch, which let you do things like as two-finger scrolling, zoom, and rotate. Whereas some implementations of multitouch have been limited to simple scrolling, like in the <p>Asus U52F-BBL9</> ($749 list, 4 stars), or have had problems with finicky touchpads, as with the Editors' Choice <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4083cl</> ($999.99 list, 4 stars), the i15R-2106MRB manages to provide a straightforward multitouch experience that works well. The Inspiron i15R-2106MRB is available only through Costco, which throws in an extended 2-year warranty. Most retailers provide just one year. Costco's Electronics Concierge Service provides toll-free technical support. Holiday shoppers will also be relieved to learn that Costco accepts returns for 90 days, which should bring some peace of mind whether you purchase the laptop for yourself or as a gift. Performance The laptop's Intel Core i3-370M performs better than the Intel i3-350M used in the <p>Dell Inspiron 14R-1898MRB</> and the <p>Acer Aspire TimelineX AS5820T-5951</> ($723 street, 4 stars). In this model, however, it seems slightly under-utilized. Compared with other Intel Core i3-370M units, like the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> ($729.99 list, 4 stars) and <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S6085</> ($799.98 list, 4 stars), the i15R-2106MRB came in just a shade lower across the board in our performance tests. On our PCMark Vantage test, the i15R-2106MRB scored 5,144. That is a little below the 5,326 earned by the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> and well below the 6,426 scored by the Editors' Choice <p>Dell XPS 15</>, which comes equipped with a Core i5 processor. It's a difference that may not be felt in simple processing tasks, but will result in a noticeable lag when multitasking in several programs. In 3DMark06, however, the i15R-2106MRB earned scores were more in line with its peers. Scores of 1,821 at medium resolution and 1,653 at native resolution were nearly identical to those of the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> (1,923 and 1,631) and Toshiba A665D-S6085 (1,891 and 1,744). If you're looking for a laptop to use for photo and video editing, the i15R-2106MRB is fine for the occasional project, but it won't give you anything near the flexibility and speed of a higher powered machine. It completed our Photoshop CS5 test in 5 minutes 40 seconds, and got through our HandBrake video encoding test in 3 minutes 10 seconds. These times aren't bad, as even the <p>Dell XPS 15</> scored 5:03 and 2:45 with a Core i5 processor and Nvidia graphics card. The lack of a discrete graphics processor means that this system isn't meant for any gaming more strenuous than Farmville, Plants Vs. Zombies, or World of Warcraft. It wouldn't even run our Crysis and Lost Planet 2 benchmark tests. If you're looking for serious gaming options, you may need to spend a bit more for a system like the <p>Asus G73JH-BST7</> ($1,399.99 list, 3.5 stars), which is built with gaming performance in mind. In the MobileMark 2007 battery test, the i15R-2106MRB lasted 3 hours 33 minutes. Though this time is easily beaten by the 7 hours 37 minutes of the <p>Acer Aspire TimelineX AS5820T-5951</>, which was designed for endurance and packed a larger battery, it's average among its peers. The <p>Dell XPS 15</> only squeezed out 3:48, and the <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S6085</> only managed 3:25. The <p>Dell Inspiron i15R-2106MRB</> has a lot to like about it, and at a reasonable price. Costco provides an extra level of protection and assistance that you won't find at other retailers. Buyers who want a Dell with top of the line features might want spend the extra $200 to pick up the Editors' Choice <p>Dell XPS 15</>. However, for day-to-day tasks like browsing the Web and composing documents, the Inspiron i15R-2106MRB provides more than enough oomph, and does so at a price that won't break the bank.
