Introduced at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show in January, the <p>Gateway FX7020</> ($1,100 direct) is part of the new breed of high-powered gaming desktops at the $1,000 price point. Although you've been able to get $1,000 gaming-class rigs from the smaller manufacturers for a while (Cyberpower and Velocity Micro come to mind), this is a mid-price gaming system from one of the big boys that you'll be able to find at retailers like Best Buy and J&R. It's powerful enough to run games like World of Warcraft, Prey, and World in Conflict. The FX7020 is a good "novice to intermediate" gaming system, since it's enough to let you play 3D-intensive games. It won't get you 100-fps benchmark scores at 2,560-by-1,600 resolution, but it will certainly be enough to play older DX9 games with all the bells and whistles turned on. The FX7020 is also ready for the next generation of DX10 gameswith even more insane graphicsjust coming to market now. The <p>Gateway FX7020</> is housed in a subdued mid-tower case that still has a bit of flash: It's painted black with red accents. I'm not a huge fan of the "painted-on" carbon fiber look surrounding the FX logo on the front panel, but otherwise this design is inoffensive. Notable features are 15-in-1 media card reader, an integrated IR receiver paired with a Media Center remote, and a built-in NTSC/ATSC (HDTV) TV tuner. When you press the Copy button on the card reader, the system automatically sucks the pictures, videos, and other types of files off the media card and into the relevant folder (Pictures, for example) in your Documents/Photos/Music folder. Once the pictures are there, you can view them in Media Center or burn them to CDs or DVDs. The FX7020 is built on the new AMD Phenom 9600 processor, one of AMD's first quad-cores for the consumer market. It runs at 2.3 GHz and is more than capable of speedy multimedia operations. The FX7020's discrete graphics card is the 512MB nVidia GeForce 8800 GT, a mid-level enthusiast card with good bang for the buck. A 500GB SATA hard drive and a dual-layer DVD burner with Labelflash (a disc-labeling feature similar to HP's LightScribe) round out the core hardware features. Labelflash is a bit clunky in that it lets you use only Labelflash-branded discs (since it's incompatible with LightScribe, you can't burn labels onto LightScribe discs). After you burn the data, you can use the bundled CyberLink LabelPrint utility to burn labels onto your CDs and DVDs. Gateway is now bundling Spare Backup with its desktops, so you can set up an auto-backup to a local drive (internal, USB, or a Gateway Portable Media Drive) or you can use the included 1GB of online storage (free forever!), with an option for a 50GB online subscription at $4.99 per month. (Still, it would have been nice if that 50GB of storage had been free.) Auto-backups can be set to occur hourly, daily, or even every 15 minutes. Speaking of subscription fees, the Norton Internet Security subscription that you get is only a 60-day trial, so you'll have to pay to keep updating your virus definitions. I think that a year's subscription should be covered, or nothing at all. Sixty days is enough to cover only the return period plus a few weeks. The FX7020 does have some other drawbacks. Since the system's motherboard has only one PCIe x16 slot, you can't install a second GeForce 8800 GT graphics card for nVidia's dual-card SLI configuration (even though the card itself is SLI-compatible). While this is an issue only for tweakers out there who want the extra power (and are willing to pay the upgrade expense) of a second graphics card, it's still a notable omission. The FX7020 also has significant bloatware, as most retail Gateway systems do. Programs like an Office 2007 trial are redundant since the system comes with Microsoft Works, and the Gateway Games, powered by WildTangent, are superfluous on a system designed with serious gamers in mind. (WildTangent games require you to buy "tokens" to play them. If I buy a game, I want to be able to play it for an unlimited number of times. Also, the games are simple ones like Diner Dash and Shrek 2: Ogre Bowler, hardly those that need a 512MB DX10 graphics card.) Last but not least, the system's optional cartridge-style Portable Media Drives ($80 for 120GB) use an unusual USB-A to USB-A cable (usual cables are A-to-B), so they're less convenient to use externally with other PCs. (Other external hard drives like the HP Pocket Media Drives can use a standard USB cable, like the one on your printer.) That said, the system is sound and will give an aspiring gamer a better-than-average experience. Thanks to the system's GeForce 8800 GT graphics, 3GB of RAM, and quad-core AMD Phenom 9600 processor, the FX7020 runs through older games like Prey and Company of Heroes at smooth, playable frame rates. Prey tallied rates of 113 fps at 1,280-by-1,024 and 56 fps at 2,560-by-1,600, while Company of Heroes scored 77 fps at 1,280-by-1,024 and 48 fps at 2,560-by-1,600. The FX7020 motored through our Windows Media Encoder test in 1 minute 7 seconds and completed our Photoshop CS3 test in a speedy 53 seconds. We've just started using new World in Conflict and Crysis benchmark tests, and the results are promising. Real-time strategy games like World in Conflict play best at 30 fps or faster, while first-person shooter games like Crysis are best at 60 fps or faster. On tests with World in Conflict, the FX7020 achieved a playable 36 fps at 1,280-by-1,024 but slowed to 16 fps at 1,920-by-1,200. Although the FX7020 meets the recommended technical specs for Crysis, you'll need to drop to a lower resolution to play that game. On our tests, Crysis at 1,280-by-1,024 (35 fps) was barely playable, and at high-quality 1,920 by 1,200 (7 fps), with very high detail levels, the game looked like a slide show. Still, if you turn down the detail level or, better yet, reduce the screen resolution, you should be able to play Crysis on the FX7020, even with some of the neat new DX10 enhancements in place. Compared with systems like the similarly priced HP Pavilion Elite m9040n, the Gateway GX7020 comes out ahead for the gamer, while the m9040n is better as a multimedia powerhouse due to its multiple hard drive bays. (The HP has two bays, for its Personal Media Drive and the smaller Pocket Media Drive cartridges, while Gateway just has the Portable Media Drive bay.) The m9040n also has a single graphics card slot, filled with a more pedestrian GeForce 8400 GS card that's less capable for gaming. The m9040n does have a larger hard drive, wireless keyboard and mouse, and CableCARD option, so it's more of a multimedia PC. The FX7020 is cheaper than the Cyberpower Gamer Infinity 8800, but the Cyberpower is dual-card SLI capable (and also ships with a single graphics card). The Cyberpower is a better pick if you're going to be adding a second graphics card and/or you think you're going to be one of those guys competing with your friends on comparative benchmark test numbers. For the gamer who will likely never open his or her PC, the <p>Gateway FX7020</> represents a good value as a capable, entry-level 3D gaming system. Its limited upgrade path takes it off the list for most gamers who might eventually want to upgrade their system into a dual-card 3D monster. (Then again, they'd tend to budget a whole lot more for their systems.) The <p>Gateway FX7020</> is a decent 3D gaming system for those who want to move up in the gaming ranks with a system that's easy to find at retailers and won't break the bank.
