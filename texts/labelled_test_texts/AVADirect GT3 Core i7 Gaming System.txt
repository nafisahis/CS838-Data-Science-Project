Nomad gamers who find themselves rolling from friend's living rooms to hotel meeting rooms and back home again know that portability can be almost as important as performance in a gaming desktop. The <p>AVADirect GT3 Core i7 Gaming System</> ($1367.26 direct) is made for them. This gaming desktop is built into a compact, semi-portable chassis, yet boasts a full-blown Core i7 quad-core processor and high-powered ATI Radeon HD graphics card. Thanks to its manageable size and reasonable weight, the GT3 is a more practical gaming rig for LAN parties than the humungous speed machines. Design The GT3 comes in a small form factor (SFF) case like what we've seen on budget PCs like the <p>HP Pavilion Slimline s5120f</>. The GT3 is about 15.5 by 4.5 by 12.5 inches (HWD), roughly the same dimensions as the s5120f though slightly taller and skinnier. While HP's system is limited to half-height graphics cards, the GT3 uses an internal riser card system that turns the graphics card orientation 90 degrees so full-sized graphics card fits in its compact chassis. The riser means that you'll have to basically disassemble a portion of the system to get to the ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics card, but, on the plus side, it keeps the heavy card secured and less likely to flap around in the case while transporting your PC. While this affects user serviceability, it's a decent tradeoff to get the performance you're looking for. The GT3's chassis is mostly ABS plastic, rather than metal, keeping the system's weight down to the point where you can feasibly carry it from place to place in a large backpack. The handled case seems sturdily built and looks presentable, though the faux carbon fiber is simply a vinyl decal placed over the front of the case. (I'm not a big fan of decals masquerading as carbon fiber.) While the decal was placed most expertly without any bubbles or creases on visible surfaces, the pattern on the vinyl applied to the front panel access door didn't quite line up with the rest of the decal. A minor nit to be sure, but I think it would stick out less if they had simply not applied the faux fiber to the door. Features The case doesn't really have a lot of extra expansion space; there's space for up to three more DDR3 DIMMs, but there's no extra room for hard drives and the only open expansion slot is a full height PCI slot. You could swap the included 500GB drive out for a 2TB one, but external expansion should be enough for the gamer on the go. A case with a quad-core processor and dual-width graphics card needs cooling, and on this system it's very noticeable. There are two front case fans and they make quite a din: thank goodness the LAN party gamer usually uses headphones. Between the front fans, graphics card fan, and power supply fan, you're talking about a whole lot of background noise. The system's software build is top notch for a gaming rig. That is to say, there isn't anything on the hard drive aside from Windows, drivers for the hardware, and software for the DVD burner. The GT3 is refreshingly devoid of ads, links to eBay, and trial versions of Office and anti-virus software. This is one of the benefits to buying from a smaller maker like AVADirect rather than bloatware-happy big PC manufacturers like HP, Gateway, and Acer. Another reason to go with a so-called boutique PC is to get customizability. While this system came with an Intel Core i7-920 processor, ATI Radeon HD 4850 card, 6GB of DDR3 SDRAM, 500GB hard drive, and a DVD burner, many other options are available on AVADirect's site, including AMD Phenom processors, Nvidia GeForce GTS 250 cards, and even the obscenely expensive Core i7-975 processor. Just make sure to balance your wants and needs: The system tops out at a 350W power supply, and that could become overloaded if you choose too many power-hungry components. Performance Not that the GT3 needs much more in terms of performance partsÂ—the system was a very good performer on our 3D games test, returning smooth playable numbers for both Crysis (81 frames per second (fps)) and World in Conflict (93 fps) at our standard 1,280-by-1,024 resolution. This is great for the travelling gamer, since he or she's more likely to cart around a smaller resolution 17- to 20-inch monitor rather than a 24- to 30-inch behemoth. Scores at the higher 1,920-by-1,200 resolution were in the "unplayable" range (Crysis was virtually a slideshow at 13 fps and World in Conflict wasn't much better at 27 fps), but good scores on those tests simply require a system with multiple graphics cards. The GT3 is also a good multimedia performer, since it finished our Windows Media Encoder test in 34 seconds and our Photoshop CS4 test in 1:20. These are both in line with other quad-core systems with single graphics cards like the <p>Dell Studio XPS 435</> and the <p>Gateway FX6801-03</>. When it comes to performance, the GT3 compares well to competitors like the <p>Gateway FX6801-03</> and the <p>Polywell Poly 790GX3</>. Both full-sized towers have more expansion space, and are in the same price range as the GT3. The more expensive <p>Falcon Northwest Talon (Core i7-950)</> still wins on performance and holds on to our mid-priced gaming Editors' Choice. The only recent gaming rigs that are similar in size are the HP Firebird 803 and the <p>Falcon Northwest FragBox 2</>, but the latter is way too expensive at almost $9,000. The Firebird was much more expensive when released ($2,099), but recent web searches peg the system's little brother (the Firebird 802) at $999.99. At that price, the Firebird becomes a compelling choice, especially since it is a lot quieter, however it is a "closed system" that won't accept graphics upgrades. The GT3 is a slightly better performer, with more overhead room and full-sized expansion though. Between the two, I'd give the aesthetic nod to the Firebird, but the GT3 wins on the more practical matters of performance and upgradeability. In the niche market that is hard-core gaming, the <p>AVADirect GT3 Core i7 Gaming System</> makes a good argument for buying rather than building. If you built a system yourself with these specs, you'd likely have to house it in a larger tower. The GT3 is a great solution for another niche of a niche (the LAN party gamer), plus it has enough performance to keep the mobile player happy. As long as you keep the over-ear or sound-isolating headphones on to block out the fan noise, this is a very good gaming PC.
