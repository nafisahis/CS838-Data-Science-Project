It's hard to see how netbooks could get much cheaper, but each new generation drives the price floor down, offering better parts for less. The <p>HP Mini 110 (1030US)</> is no exception, incorporating many elements we loved about the Mini 1000 with a few minor improvements and a significantly lower price tag. The Atom processor is the same, but the 60GB, 4,200-rpm spinning drive we called sluggish on our first look has been revved up. Add onto that an improved feature set that now includes an Ethernet port, among other updates, and you have a solid deal. Though I still have a few complaints, including the obnoxious mouse buttons, the Mini 110 is a better package overall. HP hasn't make any noticeable changes to the outside of the Mini 110it looks almost identical to the Mini 1000 and Mini 1000 Mi, with a glossy black chassis sporting gray swirls etched in the lid via in-mold decoration. However, when you look more closely there are a few notable differences. For one thing, the system itself is thicker, making room to accommodate the larger feature set and the new battery design. Unfortunately the extra girththe Mini 110 is more than an inch thickbumps it out of the increasingly crowded ultrathin category inhabited by the likes of the <p>Acer Aspire One (D250-1165)</>, the <p>Dell Inspiron Mini 12</>, and the previous HP Minis. The larger chassis has virtually no effect on the system's weight, though, which is 2.6 pounds. In the previous generation this weight would have been light for the class, but advances in competitors' systems have allowed the rest of the pack to lighten up. I was disappointed to see that HP eliminated the stunning edge-to-edge glass screen in this unit, but the trade was for an LED-backlit screen framed by shiny black plastic that resembles the previous model's screen. Currently the Mini 110 comes only with a 1,204-by-576 resolution screen, but HP promises that a higher-res (1,366-by-760) option will be available in the future. Also the palm rest feels coarse compared with the smooth plastic of the Mini 1000. The speakers are built into the frame below the screen, a smart solution that keeps them out of sight behind the hinge. Otherwise, the system has the same 92 percent keyboard, 10.1-inch widescreen and mouse buttons. The Mini is the only netbook to have the left and right mouse buttons flank the touchpad, meaning you need two fingers to navigate, which is irritating and unnecessary. (There currently isn't enough room below the touchpad to fit mouse buttons there, but it wouldn't be too hard for HP to adjust the keyboard and touchpad to fit.) The new Mini also removes the button the previous models had below the keyboard to disable the touchpad and mouse buttons. The Mini 110 comes with a number of applications preinstalled, including Syncables, a file-sharing program. Just install Syncables on any system and, as long as it's connected to the same network, the Mini 110 can access any files in that system's Documents folder and vice versa. (To get this utility to use on other machines, you have to download it from Syncables site. The free version works fine, but there are also pay versions with more capabilities.) Syncables offers various layers of security, including password protection for syncing and the ability to determine which folders and types of files are viewable by other systems. At least HP wasn't too heavy-handed with the preinstalled programs. The Mini 110 offers a few thoughtful improvements over the Mini 1000's feature set, which was pretty standard. The earlier unit offered VGA-out via an easy-to-lose dongle attachment. The 110, on the other hand, offers a proper VGA port. There's also an Ethernet port, a multi-card reader, a headphone jack, three USB ports, and a built-in webcam. This puts the Mini 110 on a par with other recent favorites, like the <p>Acer Aspire One (D250-1165)</>, the <p>Dell Inspiron Mini 12</>, and the Editors' Choice <p>ASUS EeePC 1000HE</>. It comes with 802.11g Wi-Fi; HP plans to offer a mobile broadband option in the future, an increasingly common feature for netbooks. One of our biggest complaints about the Mini 1000 was its slow-spinning 4,200-rpm hard drive and lack of upgrade options for it. The Mini 110 improves on this, coming with a 160GB, 5,400-rpm spinning drive on the low end, with options to upgrade to a 250GB, 5,400-rpm drive or a 32GB solid-state drive. The faster drive wasn't enough to give the Mini 110 any noticeable performance boost. The system scored virtually the same as its predecessor on our Windows Media Encoder test, and actually had a lower battery life score on MobileMark. That said, the Mini 110 was still a high scorer on SYSmark, losing out to the <p>Acer Aspire One (D250-1165)</>, the <p>Dell Inspiron Mini 12</>, and the <p>Samsung N120 (12GBK)</> on the Overall score by just a single point. The system's time on Windows Media Encoder was respectable at 5:01, but still behind the Editors' Choice EeePC 1000HE, which came in at 4:24. The Mini 110 trailed every comparable system on battery life, achieving only 2:39 on MobileMark. This is likely because our review unit came with a 23-Wh battery, smaller than those of most of the other systems; the Mini 110 also has an option for a 55-Wh battery. If you're comparing the <p>HP Mini 110 (1030US)</> with its direct predecessor, there's plenty to like, including more memory on a faster hard drive and an improved feature set. But when held up to its competitors, which have come a long way in the eight months since we reviewed the Mini 1000, the Mini 110 doesn't look so shiny and new. It's a perfectly capable system, but it doesn't stand out from the pack. It takes an impressive battery life like the <p>Samsung N120 (12GBK)</>, a stunning screen like the <p>Fujitsu M2010</>, or the newest performance parts like the ASUS 1000HE to make an impression in the increasingly crowded netbook market. The Mini 110 does have an impressively low price, but the <p>Acer Aspire One (D250-1165)</> has managed the same feat while staying thinner and lighter. The Mini 110 isn't a bad package, and with a bit more work, HP may even be able to elevate it above the rest of the netbook field. Check out the <p>HP Mini 110 (1030US)</>'s performance test results.
