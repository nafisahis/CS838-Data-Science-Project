No other ultraportable line captures the essence of thinking outside the box like Sony's. It was the first to introduce a sub-4-pound <p>ultraportable with an optical drive</> and discrete graphics. Its keyboard, first seen on the VAIO VGN-X505ZP, was mimicked on Apple's MacBook, and the VAIO VGN-SZ170P was switching between two different graphics solutions long before anyone had heard of switchable graphics. Their latest ultraportable, the <p>Sony VAIO VGN-Z590</>, breaks new ground once again. The dual SSDs, a Blu-ray drive, and switching graphics are features commonly found on an 8-pound media center, not a 3.2-pound ultraportable. It's amazing that Sony was able to fit the amount of technology it did into such a small frame. With the Z590, therefore, Sony retains the Editors' Choice in the ultraportable category. The Z590 measures 8.3 by 12.4 by 1.2 inches and weighs 3.2 poundsÂ—more compact and at least a half a pound lighter than its predecessor, the VAIO VGN-SZ791N. It's slightly heavier than the <p>Apple MacBook Air</> (3 pounds) but lighter than the <p>Voodoo Envy 133</> (3.5 pounds) and the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X301</> (3.3 pounds). When it comes to design, the Z590 is just as stunning as the SZ series. Clad in carbon fiber, the LED widescreen is as thin as several sheets of paper put together. Of course, since it's so thin, screen flex is a concern, but Sony has been using this design for several years now with no apparent ill affects. Aluminum, which covers the Apple Air's lid, is sturdier and arguably more elegant, while the Lenovo X301's combination of magnesium and carbon fiber materials better equip it for the bumpy road. The Z590's 13.1-inch LED widescreen is smaller than that of the SZ791N (13.3 inches). This represents the industry's movement to the 16-by-9 screen form factor, which is common in HDTV displays. The size difference is barely noticeable, because the 1,600-by-900 resolution packs in more pixels than its predecessor did, and really makes high-definition content and high-resolution photos really pop. Until now, resolution this fine was unheard of on a 13-inch laptop: The Lenovo X301 tops out at 1,440-by-900, while the Voodoo 133 and the Apple Air have 1,280-by-800 resolutions. Although the higher resolution makes the text look smaller, it's still quite readable on screen. The keyboard pitch (measured from the letters Q to P) on the Z590 is broader than on a traditional keyboard, because there's more spacing between each key. The slightly raised, non-adjoining keys are a departure from the SZ791N and are quite similar to those found on the Apple Air. Each individual key, however, measures 1.4 by 1.4 centimeters, tinier than the Air's (1.6cm by 1.6cm) and the SZ791N's (1.9cm by 1.9cm). Although the keys are smaller, your typing experience shouldn't be affected because the spacing is better. The Z590 is dominant in features and performance. Not only does it have a built-in optical drive, the drive is a Blu-ray burner. That's the reason why the screen resolution is so high and why an HDMI port is included as well, in case you want to stream all this content to a larger display. The Lenovo X301, similarly, has a Blu-ray option, but HDMI isn't built in. In the same weight category, the Voodoo 133 and the Apple Air don't even have optical drives built in, let alone Blu-ray ones. In what little space is left, the Z590 managed to fit dual 128GB SSD drives. Two drives, for a total of 256GB, is an amazing feat for a 3.2-pound laptop. It's also ridiculously expensive as a $1,400 option, and overkill for the average person. A 160GB (5,400-rpm) spinning hard drive is a good fit and brings the price down to a more realistic price point: $2,799. The Z590 comes standard with Centrino 2 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile broadband through Sprint's EV-DO Rev A. This wireless bundle isn't as formidable as the Lenovo X301's, which has all of these plus UWB, WiMax, and Gobi Wireless (a technology that unifies all 3G carriers). Also included are two USB ports, one FireWire, a 1.3-megapixel webcam, and a fingerprint reader. The Z590 comes from an excellent performance pedigree. Unlike the Lenovo X301 and the Apple Air, it doesn't sacrifice fast processors and discrete graphics cards to preserve battery life. And with the recent launch of the Intel Centrino 2 platform, inadequate battery life is no longer an issue, either. The Z590 runs on a 2.53-GHz Core 2 Duo P9500 processor. The P-series processors are designed with energy efficiency in mind, while adding the speed advantages of a T-Series processor like the one found in the SZ791N. It's a much faster alternative than the low-voltage processors found in the Lenovo X301 and the previous-generation processors found in the Apple Air and Voodoo 133. Helped by 4GB of memory, the Z590 yielded a SYSmark 2007 Preview Overall score that was more than twice that of the Air and the 133. It also surpassed that of the SZ791N by 55 percent and that of the X301 by 74 percent. The SZ170P was the first laptop to house switching graphics cards, long before Apple and Lenovo jumped on board. Like its predecessors, the Z590 has a physical switch above the keyboard that lets you choose between the nVidia chipset ("Speed") and the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4500MHD ("Stamina"). Performance, particularly with games and 3D applications, is better with the nVidia chipset, while the integrated graphics card favors battery life. A reboot is no longer required after a switch, either, thanks to the Intel Centrino 2's support for switchable graphics. When you switch to the Stamina setting, Sony's power management immediately prompts you with settings that optimize the battery, such as powering down a variety of ports (Ethernet, iLink, modem) and the optical drive, and cranking down the color bit and refresh rate of the screen. With the nVidia chipset enabled, the Z590 tallied a score of 4 hours 5 minutes on the MobileMark 2007 battery rundown test. The integrated chipset boosted the tested battery life by an hour, to 5 hours 6 minutes. An extended battery ($100) is available, too, potentially bringing battery scores well into the 7-hour range under the Stamina setting. Three years ago, Sony would have had the ultimate ultraportable had it not been for inadequate battery life. The Intel technology wasn't quite there yet, and Sony wasn't about to give up discrete graphics and the horsepower that made its ultraportables so outstanding in the first place. The VAIO VGN-Z590 proves that technology has caught up, as it is now the ultraportable to beat. Yes, this configuration is overpriced. But even when you opt out of the Blu-ray drive and the dual SSDs, its base configuration ($1,899) still ranks as better than the competition. Not only does it have a built-in optical drive, switchable graphics, superb battery life, and top-notch performance scores, it's the lightest ultraportable to have them all under one roof.
