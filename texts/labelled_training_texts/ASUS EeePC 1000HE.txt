ASUS is well into double digits in the number of netbook variants it has launched, and this seasoning has finally paid off with its best one yet. What's more, the <p>ASUS EeePC 1000HE</> ($400 street) dethrones the <p>MSI Wind</> as the leader of the pack of pint-sized laptop wannabes. What puts it on top is not its use of the first-ever Intel Atom N280 processor or its elegantly tucked-away six-cell battery, or even its revamped keyboard. In a category where price sensitivity is paramount, the 1000HE is the new Editors' Choice because it delivers all of these things at a low price. For a limited time, you can even knock an additional $25 off by subscribing to ASUS's Facebook group, or by preordering the 1000HE through an e-tailer. , the EeePC 1000HE resembles the vast majority of netbooksglossy coat, with limited color variationsthough a closer examination will reveal some design augmentations. The two colorssolid black or navy blueare your only choices, and are in line with what the <p>MSI Wind</>, the <p>Acer Aspire One (10-inch)</>, and the <p>Samsung NC10-14GB</> offer. At 3.2 pounds, it's heavier than the Aspire One (2.9 pounds), the <p>MSI Wind</> (2.6 pounds), and the NC10-14GB (2.9 pounds)and for good reason. The frame is designed around the six-cell, 63-Wh battery, eliminating the awkward protrusion you see on the back of other six-cell carriers like the Aspire One (10-inch) and the NC10-14GB. Concealing the battery, so that it is almost flush against the base, justifies the minor weight gain. In fact, the "E" in 1000HE represents the extended battery, a massive improvement over the battery in the previous EeePC 1000H. If the design improvements weren't obvious from the outside, they will be when you open the lid. The caps on the ends of the barreled hinge are trimmed with steel, and a brushed-aluminum enclosure contains the mouse buttons and the touchpadboth offer a sharp contrast with the black interior. The mouse buttons are positioned below the touchpad (where they should be) instead of flanking it to either side like those on the <p>HP Mini 2140</>. Even Acer realized the inconvenience of having the buttons adjacent to the touchpad and made the necessary changes with its latest Aspire One (10-inch). The 1000HE's mouse buttons are substantially larger than those of the Aspire One and the <p>MSI Wind</>, and they look as if they were wrapped around the front bezel in the middle of the laptop. This permits ample pinching room between the thumb and index finger when you're navigating. Though it's not the first on a laptop, the gesture-based touchpad is a first on a netbook. With two fingers, for instance, you can scroll up and down, while you can right-click using three fingers. The buttons produce faint clicking noises, so they're not as quiet as the <p>Dell Inspiron Mini 12</>'s. Like most netbooks, the 1000HE employs a 10-inch LED widescreen with a plain old 1,024-by-600 resolution. When HP announced the Mini 2140 it mentioned an option for a 1,366-by-768what the company is calling a "high-definition"screen, but it has yet to show up on HP's Web site. The Dell Mini 12 is as yet the only netbook with a native 1,280-by-800 resolution. The 1000HE's keyboard is completely revamped from the 1000H's. Depending on how you measure it, the keyboard is anywhere from 92 to 93 percent of full size, as big as the ones on the 2140 and the NC10-14GB. The keys are reminiscent of the ones on the <p>Apple MacBook 13-inch (Aluminum)</> and the <p>Sony VAIO VGN-Z590</> in that they look like oversize phone-booth keys. Typing on a keyboard of this size should be a painless adjustment. The 1000HE doesn't have a clear advantage feature-wise over other netbooks. It has three USB ports, a webcam, VGA-0ut, a 4-in-1 card reader, an Ethernet port, and 802.11n Wi-Fistandard netbook features. The only real bonus is built-in Bluetooth. (Adding an HDMI-out port would've made the 1000HE untouchable, but I digress.) The 160GB hard drive is the same as those on the <p>Acer Aspire One (10-inch)</> and the <p>Samsung NC10-14GB</>. It doesn't integrate an ExpressCard slot like the HP 2140 and the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad S10</>, and it doesn't offer built-in mobile broadband (cellular modem) like the <p>HP Mini 1000</> and the <p>Dell Inspiron Mini 9</>. The 1000HE is the first netbook to feature the 1.66-GHz Intel Atom N280 processor. On paper, it provides a minor bump in speed rating over the 1.6-GHz Intel Atom N270 CPU, and the newer memory controller platform now supports DDR2 memory rated at 667 MHz (from 533 MHz). On benchmark tests and even in real-world scenarios, you'd be hard-pressed to notice any performance differences between the 1000HE and systems like the Wind, the Aspire One (10-inch), and the HP 2140. The 1000HE's SYSmark 2007 Preview Overall score matched that of the <p>Samsung NC10-14GB</> and beat out the Wind and the 2140 by only 5 percent. Video-encoding scores topped those of the Aspire One (10-inch) and the 2140 by 3 to 4 percent. ASUS has added a software-based overclocking feature, like the one on the EeePC 1002HA that controls the speed of the CPU. You can switch between several modesSuper Performance, High Performance, Auto, and Power Savingby pressing an application key above the keyboard. Before you get too excited, the improvements are marginal. When I switched from the Auto to the Super Performance setting, the 1000HE's video-encoding test scores improved by a mere 6 percent. All of my tests were done using the Auto setting. The real benefit of transitioning to the N280 processor is the reduction in motherboard real estate, allowing slimmer form factors and potentially reducing costs. Though you couldn't tell by the 1000HE's portlier-than-average frame, the seamless integration of a six-cell battery is a result of this slimming effect. The 1000HE's 63-Wh battery rating is higher than the 58-Wh rating of the <p>Samsung NC10-14GB</> and the 48-Wh rating of the Dell Mini 12, even though all of them are six-cell batteries. When I tested the EeePC 1000HE's battery performance in our Labs, I found it very impressive. On MobileMark 2007, it scored 6 hours 36 minutes, or 46 minutes longer than the <p>Samsung NC10-14GB</>. When I used the Power Saving setting, the battery score shot up to 7 hours 26 minutes. On this setting, ASUS basically turns off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the webcam, and lowers the LCD's brightness to 40 percent. Even then, the <p>Acer Aspire One (10-inch)</> was a bigger battery phenomenon than the 1000HE, as its 8-hour, 6-minute score pummeled the competition. All of these enhancements wouldn't mean anything if the price weren't rightthat's the reason I couldn't award the Editors' Choice to the <p>HP Mini 2140</>. (Even though it's a terrific system, the <p>HP Mini 2140</> costs around $650 when everything is said and done.) The importance of price explains why the cheapest netbookthe <p>Acer Aspire One</>is also the best seller, despite its flawed typing experience. The <p>ASUS EeePC 1000HE</> makes fewer compromises than other netbooks, and the value you getin terms of design, typing experience, and battery life, among othersfor an excellent price will be tough to beat.
