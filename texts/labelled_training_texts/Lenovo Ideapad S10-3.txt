Lenovo has built a reputation for constructing quality laptop keyboards, as evidenced by those found in its ThinkPad and IdeaPad lines. But a good keyboard has somehow eluded its 10-inch netbook line until now. In addition to getting new Intel parts, the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3</> ($370 direct) has received a full-size keyboard and the kind of typing experience that has garnered praise for netbooks like the Editors' Choice <p>Toshiba mini NB305-N410</> ($400.00 Direct, ) and the <p>HP Mini 5102</> ($400 Direct, ). Unfortunately, while the Toshiba NB305 and HP 5102, which have a roomy touchpad and soft mouse buttons to compliment the keyboards, the S10-3's one-piece touchpad does the opposite. Design I like the new direction Lenovo is taking with its new netbook designs. Though the S10-3's plastics are no different than those of the original IdeaPad S10 (Red) ($410.00 Direct, ), the new checkered patterns are a departure from the dull, solid colors of previous years. They resemble carbon fiber and repel finger prints and smudges as well as the textured design found on the Toshiba NB305 and the metallic one found in the HP 5102. The Lenovo IdeaPad also comes in a red checkered lid if black is not your style. Compared with other 10-inch netbooks, the S10-3 is one of the lightest, weighing just 2.5 pounds with a 6-cell battery. The <p>Acer Aspire One</> 532h-2326 ($350.00 Street, ) isn't that much heavier at 2.6 pounds, but you'll begin to notice the weight difference with the Toshiba NB305 (2.9 lbs) and HP 5102 (2.9 lbs). The 10-inch widescreen is common among netbooks, but there are already those with bigger screens, such as the <p>HP Mini 311</> (11-inch) ($470.00 Direct, ) and <p>Asus EeePC 1201N</> (12-inch) ($484.00 Street, ). While a 10-inch screen is passable, the S10-3's 1,024-by-600 resolution is not as impressive as the 1,366-by-768 options found in the HP 5102 and <p>Dell Inspiron Mini 10s (HD)</> ($425 direct, ). Features The keyboard is arguably the biggest improvement here, as it's now a full size one (the original had a 92% keyboard). It's a new keyboard format that was first introduced with the ThinkPad Edge 13 ($899 direct, ). The keys are slightly curved and raised to a perfect height so that it almost feels like typing on a traditional keyboard, except all the keys have noticeable gaps between them. It's one of maybe three 10-inch netbooks that have full-size keyboards (the Toshiba NB305 and Samsung N-Series have them as well). Otherwise, you would have to buy an 11- or 12-inch netbook. The tradeoff of having a full-size keyboard on a 10-inch netbook is that there's only so much depth for everything else. In other words, finding room for a dedicated touchpad and mouse buttons is an onerous task. The <p>HP Mini 210-1032NR </>($349.99 List, ) and the Dell Mini 10s were faced with the same dilemma and all of them, including the S10-3, settled for an all-in-one touchpad. These clickable touchpads double as your mouse buttons; some even have multi-touch features built-in, and all of them are irritating to use. For one, their tiny footprints create an uncomfortable pinch between the index finger and thumb (for one-handed navigating). Even though Lenovo made a concerted effort to extend the touchpad past the front bezel (the ones on the Dell Mini 10s cuts off right before the bezel), clicking it is met with too much resistance, and the edge of the touchpad feels like it's cutting into your fingers. The Toshiba NB305 and HP 5102 use soft, dedicated mouse buttons and roomier touchpads, not to mention good keyboards that complement the navigating experience. The IdeaPad S10-3 has an underwhelming feature set. It doesn't offer high resolution displays and HD decoder chips like the HP 5102 and the Dell Mini 10s. In fact, it's not very configurable at all. Though it hasn't announced any plans to include a 3G modem, a SIM card slot can be found under the battery, so a heavily subsidized version is very likely. It has three USB ports, an SD card slot, Ethernet, and VGA-Out. Keep in mind that the original S10 had an ExpressCard slot; the S10-3 doesn't. And while netbooks like the Acer 532h-2326 and the Toshiba NB305 are bundling 250GB hard drives, the S10-3 ships with a 160GB drive, with no option for a bigger one. Performance The 1.66GHz Intel Atom N450 is the recurrent processor theme for this year's netbooks. Every new Intel netbook, including the S10-3, ships with this processor and promises higher-clocking one at a later date (Atom N470). In speed tests, it fared worse than netbooks that used the previous-generation Atom chips, but you'd be hard-pressed to notice this setback in real-world usage scenarios. Removing four screws from the back of the unit will allow you to upgrade memory to 2GB. Otherwise, it only ships with 1GB of RAM and Windows 7 Starter Edition. As expected, video encoding tests (4 minutes 34 seconds) and SYSMark 2007 Overall scores (37) were consistent with those of the Acer 532h-2326, Toshiba NB305, and HP 5102, all of which were also equipped with the Intel Atom N450 CPU. Battery life is about the only performance aspect you should be concerned with in this group. Even though two netbooks may ship with "6-cell" batteries, their capacities are more than likely different, usually rated in Watt-Hours. The S10-3's 48WH (6-cell) battery, for instance, is very different than the 61WH (6-cell) one found in the Toshiba NB305. That bears out in the fact that the ThinkPad S-13 scored 7 hours 6 minutes, which is almost two hours less than than the Toshiba NB305 (8:59) in MobileMark 2007. Similarly, the <p>HP Mini 5102</>'s 6-cell battery is rated at 66WH, and scored almost 11 hours on the same test. The <p>Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3</> is a tough one to judge. It's frustrating when a netbook goes through great lengths to put in an outstanding keyboard, only to have the user experience be tainted by an irritatingly small touchpad. While you can make a case that the underwhelming feature set and average battery life (yes, hard to believe that 7 hours is average for netbooks these days) are justified by a very affordable price ($370), I rather you spend an extra $30 and buy the <p>Toshiba mini NB305-N410</> ($400) or <p>HP Mini 5102</> ($400).
