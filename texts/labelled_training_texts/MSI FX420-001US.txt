You should never judge a notebook by its cover, but it doesn't hurt for a well equipped laptop to be sporting a nice design. Packing the latest second-generation Intel Core i processor, switchable AMD graphics solution, and two super speed USB 3.0 ports, the <p>MSI FX420-001US</> ($800 street) is a combination of looks and performance that will be hard to pass up. Design The <p>MSI FX420-001US</> has a unique look, thanks to MSI's "checkered flag" finish, a textured checkered pattern imprinted across the lid and palm rest of the FX420-001US. This black textured exterior is designed to both prevent fingerprints and smudging, but to resist scratching and wear as well. As a result, this attractive textured finish should keep looking good for a long time. The trackpad also has a textured finish, a pattern of dots on the pad surface. In contrast to the matte black of the chassis, the right and left buttons below the trackpad are glossy plastic, and while they click easily and feel nice, they also hide smudges surprisingly well. The touchpad itself supports two-finger gestures, letting you scroll, drag and re-size or rotate pictures without pressing a button. The keyboard on the FX420-001US is chiclet-style, with matte-finish keys. While the keys are firm and provide a very comfortable typing experience, the keyboard as a whole felt rather small. When measured from right to left, the keyboard measures under 10.5 inches, a full half-inch smaller than most full-sized keyboards. The result is a typing experience that feels slightly cramped. Along the top of the keyboard are six additional buttons: A power button, disk eject, monitor sleep, power management, and special help menus. The FX420-001US has a 14-inch screen with 1,366 by 768 resolution, the same resolution seen in most laptops of this size. The display benefited from LED backlighting, which produced more vibrant images. Complementing the screen are two stereo speakers, which use THX TruStudio Pro technology to produce sound that is clear at both quiet and loud volumes. Despite the big sound and crisp display, the X420-001US is still small enough for a commuter's bag, measuring 1.55 by 13.79 by 9.22-inches (HWD) and weighing only 4.7 pounds. Features The FX420-001US comes with a 500GB 5,400rpm hard drive, the same size as the one found in the Editors' Choice <p>Asus U45Jc-A1</> ($867 street, 4.5 stars). The built-in DVD drive will read and write both CDs and DVDs. On the left edge of the laptop you'll find a 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet connection, VGA and HDMI video outputs, and two speedy USB 3.0 ports. On the opposite edge of the FX420-001US there's a slot for a Kensington CaseLock, two USB 2.0 ports, headphone and microphone jacks, and a card reader (SD/SDHC/MMC). A 1.3-Megapixel webcam lets you Skype and video chat with 720p picture quality. MSI also provides several programs and utilities that come pre-installed on the system. While a few can easily be classified as bloatware, like the Bing toolbar and a few media demos from MSI, most are actually quite useful. For example, you may want to keep Microsoft Office 2010, Norton Internet Security and Norton Online Backup, all of which are 60-day trial versions. MSI also includes several useful utilities, such as facial recognition security, easy media sharing, and iCharge, which lets you charge an iPad from the laptop USB. But perhaps the best thing that MSI includes is its 1-year warranty covering parts and labor. Performance The FX420-001US comes equipped with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5-2410M, one of Intel's newest second-generation processors, and 6GB of RAM. The CPU is fast, and speed tests like Cinebench R11.5 show it. The FX420-001US scored 2.6 points, handily beating the first-generation Core i3 equipped <p>Asus U41JF-A1</>, which scored 2.39, and the <p>Samsung QX410-S02</> ($779.99 list, 3.5 stars), which managed 2.21 points with a first-generation Core i5. In overall performance, as measured by our PCMark Vantage test, the MSI FX420 scored 5,913 points, within striking distance of the <p>Toshiba Satellite M645-S4116</> (6,121), but well behind the <p>HP Envy 14-1210NR</> ($999.99 list, 4 stars) (6,386). In addition to the improved integrated graphics provided by the new Intel processor, the FX420-001US packs an AMD Radeon HD 6470M discrete graphics processor, providing enhanced performance in graphics intensive applications like gaming. Thanks to MSI's GPU Boost Technology, the laptop will automatically switches seamlessly between integrated and discrete graphics depending upon the needed level of graphics performance. In 3DMark06 benchmark tests, the FX420-001US scored 5,132 points at medium settings and 3,672 points at maximum resolution and detail. Its graphics capabilities also translated into gaming performance. In our Crysis benchmark test, for example, the FX420-001US cranked out 38 frames per second (fps) at medium resolution, but couldn't run the test at native resolution and higher detail settings. Similar tests like, Lost Planet 2 produced results of 16fps on medium settings, but at full resolution and detail, only 6.4fps which looks something like a rapid slideshow. The <p>HP Envy 14-1210NR</>, one of the most powerful mainstream laptops we've tested, provided much better scores in both Crysis (51.7fps medium, 11.7fps high) and Lost Planet 2 (38.2fps medium, 23fps high). High-end games like these may require a more powerful laptops built specifically with gaming in mind, but you will find that it will handle casual games quite well. In multimedia authoring the FX420-001US produced some of the best results in the category. In our Photoshop CS5 image manipulation test, it pounded through our script of image filters in 4 minutes 8 seconds, nearly identical to the <p>Toshiba Satellite M645-S4116</> (4:10), but much faster than the HP 14-1210NR (4:41) and <p>Asus U41JF-A1</> (4:52). Similar results were shown in our HandBrake video transcoding test, where the <p>MSI FX420-001US</> completed our test in 2 minutes 31 seconds, narrowly beating out both the <p>HP Envy 14</> (2:37) and <p>Asus U41JF-A1</> (2:38). It's not a big difference, but it will make the occasional photo edit go a bit more quickly and smoothly. The FX420-001US provided middle-of-the-road performance in our MobileMark 2007 battery test. Starting with a fully charged 6-cell (49Wh) battery, the FX420 managed to last 5 hours 18 minutes. While this beat out both the <p>Toshiba Satellite M645-S4116</> (4:40 with a 6-cell, 48Wh battery) and HP 14-1210NR (4:30, with a 6-cell 59Wh battery), it couldn't hope to outlast the 8:19 score of the <p>Asus U41JF-A1</>, which packs a monstrous 9-cell (83Wh) battery. The <p>MSI FX420-001US</> is a high-end mainstream laptop that combines a strong collection of components with an attractive design. While it may not top the performance of the <p>HP Envy 14-1210NR</>, or boast the graphics capabilities of the Editors' Choice <p>Asus U41JF-A1</>, it's still a strong competitor for anyone shopping for a laptop that does a little bit of everything.
