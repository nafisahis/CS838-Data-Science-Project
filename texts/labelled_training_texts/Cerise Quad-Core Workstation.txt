The <p>Cerise Quad-Core Workstation</> ($3,342 direct) is aimed at professionals who want a simple, quiet, yet powerful multimedia PC. In keeping with this theme, it comes with no bloatware, no fancy extras, and almost noiseless operation. What it does have is a powerful quad-core processor; a RAID 5 array for safe, quick storage; and a ready-for-work attitude. It's a work computer rather than the gaming box you usually find at this price point. Your investment buys you a system ready to earn you money, with the speed and storage to keep your projects on track. The Quad-Core Workstation comes in a standard-looking Silverstone TJ10 silver-colored case, with a door that hides the system's optical drive bays. The case is optimized for cooling, with numerous vents. The case itself is spacious, with extra room for future expansion, including extra hard drives, PCI and PCIe expansion cards, and additional optical drives. You could even go with another graphics card for an SLI configuration, but quiet performance, not graphics, is the focus of this system. The four hard drives have their own chamber, separated from the rest of the system. This means that when you're doing disk-heavy tasks like video editing, the hard drives won't heat up the rest of the components, such as the temperature-sensitive CPU. Although there's space in the case for liquid cooling, Cerise doesn't offer it. (To ensure reliability, Cerise doesn't overclock its components, so no heavy-duty liquid cooling is needed.) Cerise spares you the scads of bloatware you'd find on your usual consumer-level PC. The workstation's hard drive was empty except for a Microsoft Office demo. You don't want preloaded software mucking up your professional-level apps if you're buying a computer to make your living. Trialware and other bloatware can introduce software errors, even if you remove it prior to doing real work. The system comes with four 500GB, 7,200-rpm hard drives. Three of the drives are set up in a RAID 5 array, so if one of the three fails, you'll still be able to use the system until the bad drive is replaced. The system uses a PCIe SATA RAID card plugged into the motherboard. Since one drive's space is always lost in a RAID 5 array, this gives you "only" 1TB on the data drive. That's an acceptable trade-off for data security, particularly for its target market of multimedia pros who run through hard drives quickly. The fourth drive, with the same specs as the others, serves as the system's C: drive. In addition to the extra drive space, RAID 5 will give you better performance than a single drive, especially when you compare it with an external hard drive. When I ran Futuremark's PCMark05 disk test on the Cerise's RAID array, it came back with a score of 6,627, which far outpaces even a quick eSATA external drive like the LaCie Little Big Disk Quadra (4,721) by 40 percent. With 1TB, you have the space to work on digital photos, uncompressed audio, or video. Since the system has 3GB of DDR2 memory, you are in a good space as long as you don't need 64-bit computing. The system I reviewed came with Windows XP Home, which is fine as long as you don't need to hook up to a corporate network with Windows Domain support. Windows XP Pro, Vista Home Premium, and Vista Ultimate 32-bit are also supported by Cerise as options when you buy the system. Cerise chose XP because there is still a significant user base on XP, and more software and hardware drivers are supported by XP than by Vista. The system's quad-core Core 2 Quad Q6700 processor, running at a stock 2.67 GHz, helped the Cerise achieve very good scores on our multimedia benchmark tests. Our test unit finished the Windows Media Encoder test in a sprightly 56 seconds (below 1 minute is very good), and ripped through our Photoshop CS3 test in 26 seconds (below 1 minute is very good; below 30 seconds is excellent). The Cerise garnered a very high score (9,523) on CineBench R10, showing that the Q6700 processor is a powerhouse on multimedia tasks. Its SYSmark 2007 Preview Overall score (131) was average for high-end PCs (that is, better than average overall), indicating that this desktop is good at day-to-day professional and business tasks. The desktop's 3D performance was an adequate if uninspiring 5,459 points on 3DMark06, adequate for basic real-time rendering and gaming (though a pro animator would want a higher-end workstation with a pro-level graphics card). The nVidia GeForce 8600 GT that my review system came with is a decent mid-level graphics cardÂ—nothing special, but fully DX10-compatible. It could serve well for years before needing to be replaced. The 8600 GT has a vital advantage over more costly gaming-class cards: It's quiet. If you do need a faster card, Cerise can drop in an 8600 GTS for about $70 more, though that may be louder as well. Unlike multimedia systems such as the <p>Velocity Micro Edge M40</>, the Cerise Quad-Core eschews dual graphics, funneling that expenditure to the hardware RAID card and extra drives. That configuration makes the Cerise a lot quieter than systems like the Edge M40 and the <p>Polywell Poly X3800</>. In fact, the Cerise is the quietest tower PC I currently have on my test bench. To get any quieter, you have to go to the totally fanless <p>Zonbu Desktop Mini</>. If there are any disadvantages to owning a <p>Cerise Quad-Core Workstation</>, they are the limited tech support hours (9 through 5 eastern, Monday through Friday), and the choice of XP Home over XP Pro. Okay, maybe it's a little big for a desktop, but that's fine in a multimedia workhorse PC. The <p>Cerise Quad-Core Workstation</> is a no-nonsense multimedia workhorse PC. It has no frills, aside from quiet operation and quality construction. Those are both features you'd be hard pressed to find on an average consumer or do-it-yourself PC. If you want to buy a powerful workstation but would rather stay with more pedestrian (and cheaper) consumer-grade components, the Cerise should be on your short list.
