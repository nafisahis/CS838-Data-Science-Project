The gap between what the Apple MacBook offers versus its pricier counterpart, the MacBook Pro 13-inch ($1,199 direct, ) is narrowing. The 13-inch <p>Apple MacBook (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz)</> ($999 direct) has updated its core components while keeping its design and features the same. While you get the expected processor bump (to the 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU), the better 3D graphics system (with the Nvidia GeForce 320M) and better battery life (with a bigger 63.5WH battery) are the more compelling upgrades. The MacBook doesn't have the MacBook Pro's SD card slot, backlit keyboard, or aluminum design, but for $200 less, it's a nice value play for Mac-loving students and homebodies alike. Fashionable Plastics and an Unrivaled Touchpad Since the iBook G4s made their debut, polycarbonate plastic have been a staple of Apple's most affordable laptop lines. These materials are derived from a similar kind used in bullet-proof glass, hardened to handle its fair share of abuse, yet they're attractive and less expensive to implement than metals. Aluminum casings, on the other hand, tends to crop up in luxury and higher-end laptops, such as the MacBook Pro 13-inch, Asus U30Jc-1A ($899 street, ), and <p>HP Pavilion dm4</> ($905 direct, ). Despite the fact that plastic is thick and harder to work with than metals, the MacBook is unquestionably thin (1 inch thick) and weighs just 4.6 pounds, which is roughly the same weight as the U30Jc-1A (4.7 lbs) and the MacBook Pro 13-inch (4.5 lbs). Although 13.3-inch widescreens are very common nowadays, the MacBook is one of the few remaining ones that run a 1,280 by 800 resolution. Systems like the Asus U30Jc-1A and <p>Dell Inspiron 1464</> ($670 direct, ) have similar 1,366 by 768 resolutions, and are comparable to the MacBook in terms of screen brightness, clarity, and sharpness. The MacBook and the MacBook Pro 13-inch use a chiclet-style keyboard, but the MacBook lacks the backlights under the keyboard혰a handy feature, if you work in low-lit places. If the typing experience is paramount, I think the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Edge 13</> ($899 direct, ) has a better chiclet keyboard; the Dell Inspiron 14 has the best typing experience with its traditional keyboard. Apple's click touchpad is arguably the best in the industry. Even though I'm a bigger fan of dedicated mouse buttons, Apple's navigation experience is perfectly executed. The oversized touchpad recognizes up to four fingers and can flawlessly execute numerous touch commands, including a new one called motion-scrolling. Many have tried to emulate Apple's touch gestures혰and all have fallen short. Case in point: The HP dm4 had issues with jumping cursors and invoking touch commands that weren't called upon. The touchpad itself is astonishingly large, yet there's still plenty of room to comfortably rest your palms. Underwhelming Features, Great Software The MacBook's features are left virtually untouched from the previous version, except for one minor improvement: The DisplayPort streams both audio and video now (the previous version was video-only). For anyone who owns a MacBook and a digital camera, I feel your frustration. An SD card slot, a vital feature found in MacBook Pros (13 and 15-inch only) and any Windows-based laptop (even a netbook), is once again missing from the MacBook. The rest of the feature set is modest at best, including two USB ports, the mini-DisplayPort, Ethernet, and headphone jack. Even the 250GB hard drive seems small compared with that of the Asus U30Jc-1A (320GB) and Dell 1464 (500GB). MacBook hard drives can be upgraded to higher capacities; at which point, prices would inch you closer to a MacBook Pro 13-inch configuration. Where the MacBook falls short in features, it certainly makes up for in software. No other laptop manufacturer bundles a better software suite, which includes iLife '09 and countless utilities. And although the 1-year warranty is pretty standard, Apple's customer care is rated top in the business. Better Gaming, Longer Battery Life The 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 processor is a minor speed bump from the previous MacBook and matches the one found in the MacBook Pro 13-inch's base configuration. It's not as fast as Intel's Core i3 and Core i5 processors, which can be found in virtually every other laptop (The Core 2 Duos are based on last year's technology). We ran performance tests in both Windows (via Bootcamp) and in OS 10.6.1. Video encoding tests, which measures processor speeds favored the Asus U30Jc-1A, Dell 1464, and HP dm4. The MacBook scored 1 minute 8 seconds, trailing the Asus U30Jc-1A (50 seconds) and HP dm4 (47 seconds) by a considerable margin. Tests such as PCMark Vantage and Cinbench R10 (done in the Mac operating system), which measure overall performance, didn't fare well either. Aside from the processor, the discrepancy can also be attributed to the MacBook having less system memory (2GB) than its competitors (all with 4GB). And it's difficult to find any mainstream laptop that ships with less than 4GB of memory these days. Though its speed was underwhelming, the MacBook gained back some ground courtesy of a new graphics chipset from the Nvidia. The GeForce 320M is an integrated chipset, but has more 3D firepower than the discrete cards found in the Asus U30Jc-1A and HP dm4. On the 3DMark06 (5,231) and Crysis (26.8 fps) tests, the MacBook was clearly the better gaming machine compared with its two competitors. And it has HD benefits as well, as an Nvidia-based graphic chipset can offload some of the video decoding work from the processor. In other words, HD videos혰720p and 1080p varieties혰looked crisp and was completely free of lag and fragments. Like the MacBook Pro 13-inch, the MacBook now ships with a bigger battery (from 58WH to 63.5WH), and thus, more battery life. Compared with the previous iteration, battery life jumped from 4 hours 35 minutes to 7:12 in MobileMark 2007 (a Windows-based test). Curiously, the MacBook lasted longer than the MacBook Pro 13-inch (5:05), despite having the same batteries and parts. I also did a video rundown (looped an MP4 video file) in OS 10.6.1 and came to a similar conclusion: The MacBook scored 6:47 in this test in OS 10.6.1, while the MacBook Pro 13-inch lasted 5:18. This indicates that the MacBook is more battery-efficient than the MacBook Pro 13-unch. I suspect that plastics are a better heat retardant than metals, and the empty memory slot in the MacBook could have played a role in conserving battery life. Basic Web surfing on the MacBook, according to Apple, will last for over 10 hours. In comparison, the Asus U30Jc-1A, which bundles a bigger battery (84WH), delivered 8 hours of battery life in MobileMark 2007. The <p>Apple MacBook (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz)</> is for Mac-loving students and general-purpose users who don't need the SD card slot, the illuminated keyboard, and the aluminum design of a MacBook Pro. It's a beautiful machine, topped only by an amazing user experience, excellent battery life, and Apple's reputation for being an outstanding service provider. Compared with its Windows counterparts, the lack of an SD slot and starting with just 2GB of memory are reasons enough to recommend the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) over the MacBook. That, or go with our Editors' Choice for the mainstream category, the Asus U30Jc-1A.
