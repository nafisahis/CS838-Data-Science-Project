When we looked at an engineering prototype of the <p>Acer AspireRevo</> in early 2009, the combination of Nvidia Ion graphics and Intel Atom processor was promising, to say the least. The <p>Acer AspireRevo</> AspireRevo R3610-U9022 ($330 list) is now on sale, and it's a beaut. It's still in the same chassis and still has its love-it-or-leave-it styling, but it's certainly an improved model: it's packing a dual-core Intel Atom 330 processor and Windows 7. (A single-core version of the AspireRevo is also available.) It's very well equipped, has enough power for light use like Office-type tasks, Web surfing, and even Blu-ray playback, plus it's less than $350. Look at the AspireRevo as a bedroom or living room PC (basically, for any room with an HDTV in it), or as a PC to use when all you want to do is get on the Web. Design The AspireRevo R3610-U9022's chassis is a tilted vertical box, with the USB and other ports along the outer edge of the case. The AspireRevo has six USB 2.0 ports, VGA, HDMI, eSATA, 4-in-1 card reader, audio (both analog and digital) and Ethernet. If you hooked connectors up to all the ports, the system would look like a sea urchin, but with the included wireless keyboard and mouse, the system could only have four ports occupied: power (a jack for the power adapter plug), monitor, USB speakers, and the wireless USB dongle. It was a little confusing setting up the AspireRevo at first, since the USB dongle was hidden in the battery compartment of the mouse. (Once found it's easy to use.) The dongle is a slim one, jutting out about a half centimeter, so it doesn't ruin the system's sleek lines. As before, the system can be mounted on its included stand, which is sort of like a kickstand or a foot. When on the stand, the system is tilted toward the user, who can plug USB and media cards in easily. The system's eSATA port is also on the front, so you can hook up speedy hard drives in an instant. If the AspireRevo looks jaunty when it's tilted like that, there is a solution: the system can be hidden. It also comes with a VESA mount kit, so if your HDTV or LCD monitor has a VESA mount capability, you can attach the AspireRevo to the back, creating an all-in-one PC effect. The AspireRevo remains hidden behind the flat screen, so you can use the computer without seeing it. On most systems, a pair of USB speakers would be an unremarkable feature, since almost all are tinny sounding and ugly. However, the AspireRevo's included speakers are tiny, and attractive enough to sit on the counter in your Poggenpohl kitchen. They have semi-spherical cone drivers, kind of like the ones on the Harman/Kardon Soundsticks. They look great, and sound pretty good too. There's no distortion when you pump the volume up to max. Features The AspireRevo R3610-U9022 comes with wireless keyboard and mouse. This is a vast improvement over other nettops like the <p>ASUS Eee Top 1602</> with its wired keyboard and mouse, or the <p>Polywell Giada ION-100</>, which doesn't have a keyboard or mouse at all. The AspireRevo's island-style keyboard is a bit springy, but otherwise it has good typing feel. The included wireless mouse is a standard scroll-wheel optical mouse without a back button. The system comes with 2GB of DDR2 memory and a 160GB hard drive, both sufficient for the Web/media consumption usage model you'd expect from the AspireRevo. The AspireRevo really isn't designed to be user serviceable, so everything is built in, including 802.11b/g/n WiFi networking and the Nvidia ION graphics, which are sufficient for Windows 7's Aero effects as well as Blu-ray movie decoding. You can get into the chassis by undoing a single screw and prying the lid off, but there's no extra space in the chassis for upgrades: if you want to upgrade the memory, hard drive, or wireless, you have to remove something first. The AspireRevo doesn't come with a built-in optical drive, so you'll need to use an external one if you want to watch Blu-ray movies through the system. Both complaints are relatively minor, since you're considering this nettop for its compact nature. About the only solid bone I have to pick with the AspireRevo is the boatload of bloatware loaded on the hard drive. Stuff like eSobi, Microsoft Office 60-day trial, MyWinLocker, and Acer/WildTangent Games are superfluous, can be downloaded off the Internet for free, and bog down the system if you get rid of them, since uninstalling these programs always leaves extra files all over the hard drive. The McAfee Internet Security package is comprehensive, but it's only got a 60-day trial subscription, so it won't update to new threats unless you pay for the full package. Performance The AspireRevo really isn't a speed burner in the benchmark tests: it takes a relatively leisurely 3 minutes 10 seconds to finish out the Windows Media Encoder test, and 8:03 to finish the Photoshop CS4 test. These are both very long process times compared with Core 2 Duo-powered systems like the <p>Apple Mac mini </>(1:17 WME, 3:45 CS4). However the AspireRevo is faster than a system running a single-core Atom like the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q110 (4:59 WME, 9:56 CS4). Let's put it this way: you can stand to do the occasional light editing procedure on the AspireRevo like cropping a photo or removing red eye, but if you have to do more strenuous tasks like applying blur filters or manually airbrushing blemishes out of photos and videos, then you want a more powerful system. The PCMark Vantage test shows the system's performance in day-to-day tasks like playing back videos, surfing the Web, and doing office tasks. The AspireRevo was able to garner a respectable 1,921 point score. This is on the high end of Atom-powered nettops: the Lenovo Q110 chalked up a measly 1,276, and the Polywell Giada lagged the AspireRevo with a 1,737-point score. In informal testing, the AspireRevo was a little sluggish compared to a Core 2 Duo desktop or laptop, but it was about the same speed as a netbook or other nettops. Again, you can do your everyday tasks on it fine; it's just slower when you get to more strenuous tasks. Video playback is important to any PC you would consider hooking up to a HDTV. The AspireRevo is fine out of the box playing back Standard Definition (SD) Web videos thanks to its dual-core processor, but it chokes a little when trying to play HD online videos. The next version of Adobe Flash 10.1 will be able to help with video playback, since it is designed to work with the Nvidia Ion GPU to play high-resolution videos smoother. The beta version of Flash 10.1 bore this out, and the release version may be online by the time you read this. The <p>Acer AspireRevo</> R3610-U9022 certainly outperforms the smaller single-core nettops like the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q110 and the ViewSonic VOT120, but this is to be expected since the Acer has both a dual core processor and Nvidia Ion. The VOT120 is essentially notable for how small it is: it will disappear when mounted behind even a medium-sized monitor. So compared with the dual-core Atom/Ion competition like the <p>ASUS Eee Top ET2002</> and <p>Polywell Giada ION-100</>, the <p>Acer AspireRevo</> R3610-U9022 wins because of its bang for the buck: wireless keyboard and mouse, cheaper price, ports galore, and its ability to hide behind large screen monitors with its VESA mountability. It's just about all you can ask for in a nettop that's not an all-in-one. If it didn't have so much bloatware on it, it might have even gotten a 5 out of 5 score. The <p>Acer AspireRevo</> R3610-U9022 sets the bar for (detached) nettops as the new Editors' Choice, where it stands alongside the Lenovo C300, the all-in-one nettop Editors' Choice.
