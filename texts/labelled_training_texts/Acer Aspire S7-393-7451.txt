Editors' Note (6/8/2015): After this review was posted, a retest of the battery life showed that the <p>Acer Aspire S7-393-7451</> lasted 9 hours 57 minutes, which is more than 3 hours longer than the original test result of 6:20. We have updated the review and benchmark chart accordingly, and raised the S7-393-7451's rating from 3.5 to 4. Thin. Lightweight. Portable. The <p>Acer Aspire S7-393-7451</> ($1,299.99 as tested) checks all the right boxes when it comes to finding a sleek and mobile high-end ultraportable laptop. The design is sharp—with an aluminum unibody chassis and Gorilla Glass lid—the components are capable, and the price isn't bad. But a sleek design isn't everything when other systems offer as much for similar prices, and the Aspire S7 comes with too much bloatware and too few ports to completely win me over, especially when comparing it to systems like the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch or the newest <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch</>, Retina Display, our Editors' Choice high-end ultraportable. Design The design and look of the Aspire S7-393-7451 is relatively unchanged since the first Aspire S7 was introduced in 2012, with the same aluminum unibody chassis, white Gorilla Glass-covered lid, and thin and light dimensions. This svelte ultrabook measures just 0.51 by 12.7 by 8.8 inches (HWD), and weighs only 2.87 pounds. That's even slimmer than the 0.6-inch-thick <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch and 0.54-inch-thick <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</>. That thin profile is especially impressive when you consider the fact that the laptop's 13.3-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080) display is a touch screen, which usually adds thickness. The display has an In-Plane Switching (IPS) panel, providing excellent sharpness, brightness, and color quality from nearly any angle. The screen also opens out to a maximum of 180 degrees, so you could use the laptop as a flat, shared display for another person or group. The accompanying speakers with Dolby audio enhancements are also very good, with clear sound and enough volume to fill a room, but there's a very slight buzz at high volumes. The chiclet-style keyboard is just as thin, with the minimal key travel you might expect, but the underlying switches provide a fair amount of resistance, and don't feel flimsy. The plastic keycaps have a silver, metallic finish, with backlit lettering. The backlighting is also automatic, adjusting to the room's lighting on its own, though you can tweak the brightness or turn it on and off manually. The one issue we've seen more than once with the Aspire S7 is that the silver finish on the keys, when combined with the backlighting, makes the lettering nearly invisible under certain lighting conditions. Features The slim design of the Aspire S7 doesn't leave a lot of room for ports, but there are still a few. On the right you'll find a mini DisplayPort, an HDMI output, a USB 3.0 port, and a headset jack. On the left is the laptop's Power connector and Power button, along with a second USB 3.0 port and an SD card slot. With only a few ports, wireless connectivity is essential, and the laptop is outfitted with dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, as well as Intel WiDi for wireless media streaming. For storage, the Aspire S7 is equipped with a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD), which is a standard size drive for ultrabooks. It might seem a bit small for anyone working with large media files, but for most users, that's enough for daily use. Similar drives are found in the previous <p>Acer Aspire S7-392-5410</> and the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch, though the latest <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch</> opts for a smaller 128GB drive. Acer also includes a lot of preinstalled software, with several apps on the Start screen, and more utilities on the desktop. Some of these are free trials, like a 30-day trial of Microsoft Office 365, and a free 30-day trial subscription for McAfee LiveSafe Security. Some are useful programs, like CyberLink Media Suite, Foxit Phantom PDF, and Nuance Dragon Assistant. Others might be apps and services you want to clear off, like paid services (Netflix, HuluPlus), shopping apps (Amazon, Ebay), or sample games (WildTangent). On top of all that, Acer includes several proprietary apps, called abApps (short for Acer BYOC Apps, with BYOC being short for Acer's Bring-Your-Own-Cloud connected storage solution). These apps work with both Acer PCs and Android or iOS smartphones and tablets, letting you stream your own music collection when you're out and about, or access and edit documents stored on your Acer PC while you're away. It's Acer's own approach to cloud services, but with the unique twist that all of the storage is limited to the storage in your Acer PCs. For using this service, Acer includes four abApps: abDocs, abFiles, abMedia, and abPhoto. Acer covers the Aspire S7-393-7451 with a one-year warranty. Performance Our review unit has a 2.4GHz Intel Core i7-5500U dual-core processor, an ultrabook-class CPU similar to the low-voltage model used in the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch and a step up from the older Intel Core i5 used in last year's <p>Acer Aspire S7-392-5410</>. Combined with 8GB of RAM, the Aspire S7 delivered solid performance on our productivity tests, but it's not as impressive as competitors. The Aspire S7 scored 2,428 points in PCMark 8 Work Conventional, compared with the Acer S7-392-5410 (2,708 points) and the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch (2,987 points). The 12-inch Apple MacBook, which rivals the Aspire S7 for thinness, doesn't even come close, lagging well behind in other processor-intensive tasks due its less potent Intel Core M CPU. In multimedia tests, the Aspire S7 fared much better, completing our Handbrake video encoding test in 1 minute 19 seconds, which is much faster than the Acer S7-392-5410 (4:53) and ahead of both the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch (2:58) and the Apple MacBook Pro (2:38). The laptop also finished our Photoshop test in 3:04, ahead of the Acer S7-392-5410 (5:16), the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch (5:54), and the Apple MacBook Pro (4:17). Regardless of what your other daily processing needs may be, if you spend a lot of time working with photos or videos, the current Acer Aspire S7 is clearly to one to choose over the competition. In graphics and gaming performance, the results aren't as glowing. With its integrated Intel HD Graphics 5500 graphics solution, the Aspire S7 scored 4,536 points in 3DMark Cloud Gate (our basic graphics test) and 340 points in Fire Strike Extreme (our more demanding test). This score handily outpaced the previous Acer S7-392-5410, which scored 3,960 points (Cloud Gate) and 235 (Fire Strike Extreme), but it lagged slightly behind the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch, which scored 4,852 points (Cloud Gate) and 346 points (Fire Strike Extreme). Similarly, the laptop produced decent results in our Heaven and Valley gaming tests, though (as expected) not gaming-capable performance. The Aspire S7's battery lasted 9 hours 57 minutes in our rundown test, an impressive time, but it still falls short when compared with the Apple MacBook Pro (11:10). It outlasts several competitors, like the Acer S7-392-5410 (8:22), the <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> (8:15), and the <p>Dell XPS 13</> Touch (7:40), but the Dell lasts even longer with a secondary battery (12:55). In any event, the Aspire S7 will carry you through a full day of work or school, with a few hours to spare. Conclusion The <p>Acer Aspire S7-393-7451</> is in many ways just as impressive as when it was first announced, with a delightfully slim and light chassis, the distinctive design of its Gorilla-Glass-covered lid, and decent performance and great battery life. Unfortunately, it also has a limited selection of ports and a lot of bloatware. While the S7-393-7451 is definitely worth considering, our Editors' Choice for high-end ultraportables remains the latest 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro.
