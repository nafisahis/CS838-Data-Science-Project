In previous years, HP's laptop line-up included the G-series, a range of budget notebooks that delivered all the basic computing essentials, but didn't have a lot going for it in the looks department. Now, the G-series has been brought into the Pavilion line, updated with a lower-case "g" and a slick new design that stays basic, but adds a sophisticated sheen. The <p>HP Pavilion g7-1033cl</> ($649.99 list, from Costco) is the first member of the new g-series we've gotten to review, and we weren't disappointed. Design The g7-1103cl sports a clean design, with a sleek glossy lid adorned only with a glowing HP logo in one corner. The light grey plastic of our review unit had slightly metallic sheen to it, and despite the glossy surface, it didn't pick up many fingerprints. The interior of the laptop has a two-toned color scheme, where the light grey of the lid is accented by a darker gray border running along the edges of the laptop. The Pavilion g7 is also available in a variety of hues, like blue, magenta, and purple. It measures 1.45 by 16.25 by 10.7 inches (HWD), and weighs 6.1 pounds, which is lighter than the <p>Dell Inspiron 17R-1695MRB</> ($799.98 list, 4 stars) which weighed 6.6 pounds. The touchpad is molded seamlessly into the palm rest, with the touchpad surface easily distinguished by a textured pattern of raised dots. Unlike previous HP Pavilion models, the g7 is one of the new line that does not use a clickpad, but returns to standard right and left mouse buttons on the bottom edge of the trackpad. This change also means that the g7-1103cl's touchpad has none of the jumpy tracking, misread gestures, or false positives that dogged the Pavilion line last year. The multitouch features all work properly, and the separate mouse buttons allow you to rest your thumb on them without causing problems - something the previous clickpads (with its integrated mouse buttons) wouldn't let you do. The full-sized keyboard has a traditional layout with adjoining keys, but thanks to a raised square profile on each key, the typing experience was more like that of a chiclet keyboard. The keys were a bit mushy for my tastes, and HP has squeezed the four arrow keys into three keys' worth of space, with the up and down arrows getting only half-sized keys. The full sized numeric pad will please anyone who has to crunch a number or two, and it rounds out the keyboard nicely. The 17.6-inch widescreen display offers plenty of screen real estate for running two windows side by side, and its 1,600-by-900 resolution will display 720p video easily. There are two integrated Altec Lansing speakers and SRS Premium Sound software. Where most budget laptops use sub-par speakers, the sound on the g7-1103cl's speakers is fairly good, providing decent sound at low- to mid-volume, though distorting when turned up high. Audiophiles may not be pleased, but at least you can enjoy a movie or some music without requiring headphones or external speakers. Features The g7-1033cl sports a large 500GB 5,400rpm hard drive, the same size and speed as the drives found in the Editors' Choice <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</>($599.99 list, 4 stars) and the <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</>($599 list, 3.5 stars). The DVD burner is par for the course. A standard collection of connectors and ports includes 3 USB 2.0 ports, VGA, Ethernet, and a media card reader that supports SD and MMC cards. An HDMI port makes a nice addition, letting you easily connect to an HDTV. The g7-1033cl, like many budget laptops, comes with its share of pre-installed programs and utilities, including regular offenders like a dedicated eBay link on the desktop, a handful of proprietary programs like HP's PictureMover and HP Movie Store, and a collection of sample games from WildTangent. Unlike most other low priced laptops, HP put a number of useful tools into the mix, like Skype, Microsoft Office 2010 Starter pack, a trial of QuickBooks, Quicken, and TurboTax, and LoJack laptop location. Because this is a Costco configuration, buyers enjoy a couple of perks the wholesale retailer includes. Top on the list is the free extended warranty, doubling the manufacturers warranty from one year to two, at no extra cost. Buyers can also make use of Costco's Electronics Concierge Service, a free technical support line that is also included with purchase. Performance Many budget laptops force buyers to sacrifice performance in order to bring down the price, whittling away at the cost by using slow processors and older components. Thankfully, the g7-1103cl is equipped with an Intel Core i3-380M processor. While it may not be Intel's newest or fastest CPU, the speedy dual-core processor is a step up from the underpowered netbook chips making their way into some budget laptops, like the <p>Toshiba Satellite L645D-S4025</> ($498 list, 3 stars) with its AMD Athlon II P320 CPU. Thanks to the dual-core processor and included 4GB of RAM, the Pavilion g7-1103cl performed well in PCMark Vantage, our general processor test, scoring 5,590 points. This score was fairly similar to the Editors' Choice Acer AS5742-6475 (5,639), but easily surpassed the AMD equipped <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S5175</> ($799.99 list, 3 stars) (4,185). The scores evened out in our Cinebench R11.5 test, which favors multiple processor cores, with the quad-core <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S5175</> scoring 2.05, and the Pavilion g7-1033cl scoring 2.09 using it's dual-core processor with Hyperthreading, which allows the two cores to process four processing threads at once. It performed well in other processor-intensive tests, like Handbrake (3:00) and Photoshop CS5 (5:23), nearly identical to the <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</> (3:00 Handbrake, 5:27 Photoshop), but significantly better than the Toshiba A665D-S5175 (4:03 Handbrake, 9:03 Photoshop). Because the g7-1033cl uses Intel's integrated graphics solution, performance in high-end graphics and gaming is limited. In 3DMark06, it scored 1,995 points at medium settings and 1,533 at native resolution. When it comes to actual gaming, the g7-1033cl is limited to 2D gaming and Web games, as it wouldn't run either of our gaming tests, Crysis or Lost Planet 2. The g7-1103cl comes with a 6-cell 47Wh battery, and though this isn't any larger than the batteries on its peers, it did last 4 hours 5 minutes in our MobileMark battery life test. This is better than the <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</>, which lasted 3:49, but not as impressive as the Acer AS5742-6475, which lasted 5:01Â—and both use a similar 48Wh battery and had nearly identical specs. The HP Pavlion g7-1033cl has brought an updated look to a budget notebook classic, and has made this basic laptop hard to beat. Though the Editors' Choice <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</> has similar overall performance, it still wins out thanks to a longer lasting battery and a lower overall price tag.
