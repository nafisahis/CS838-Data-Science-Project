The <p>HP Pavilion p6537c-b</> ($849.99 list) is a mainstream desktop PC with a bundled 23-ich widescreen monitor. It has plenty of features that the average user will find appealing, and the included 23-inch monitor certainly gives the mutlitasker plenty of screen real estate for multiple open windows. It also has the power to edit and convert photos and videos, so you can enjoy them on your portable devices like your smartphone or music player. In addition, the p6537c-b, available at Costco, has room to expand. It's a good, middle of the road desktop for the user that needs a big screen and something a little more substantial than a 17-inch laptop. Design The p6537c-b follows HP's standard mid-range design that is all high-quality glossy black plastic and silver accents. As on other HP Pavilion p6000 systems like the p6516f-b and p6510f the system has a drop-down sliding panel hiding two USB 2.0 ports, the microphone jack and the headphone jack. The DVD burner drive and free optical drive bay sit under a multi-card reader. The design scheme carries over to the 23-inch monitor perfectly, and the same black/sliver trim motif is seen in the keyboard as well. Since the p6537c-b is built into a minitower case, it has a lot of expansion room inside. In addition to one free RAM DIMM slot for more memory, you can add a PCIe x1 card, one PCIe x16 card, and a MiniCard (a small PCIe slot for stuff like WiFi). There are two free hard drive bays and one free optical drive bay, which gives you a lot of room to expand by adding extra drives. The system will be able to handle a small graphics card like a Radeon HD 5670 or 5550not that you really need it, since the system is designed around 2D videos and photos rather than 3D. The system has 4 more USB ports in the back, for a total of six. That's pretty good, but the system lacks the faster FireWire or eSATA interfaces that serious digital photo or video hobbyists and professionals use to connect external hard drives. But for the p6537c-b's low asking price, the lack of these two features is hardly a dealbreaker. Features The HP 2310m monitor is crisp and bright, and has a 1080p HD (1,920 by 1,080) resolution screen. You can watch full-size 1080p videos from the Internet, though a Blu-ray reader for true HD nuts would've been a welcome feature. You'll have to look for a more expensive model if you want Blu-ray in the packaged deal, but at this price point, the lack of Blu-ray is understandable. The p6537c-b shines with a 750GB hard drive, so you can download all of those movies in 1080p from digital markets like iTunes or watch streaming sites like YouTube. I would have liked to have seen an HDMI port on the system with HDMI cable included, since the monitor has an HDMI port. You'll have to hook up the included DVI and audio cables separately, which makes for more clutter hook up rather than a one-wire solution. The system comes with a 2-year warranty for the desktop's hardware, but the software, monitor, and tech support are covered for only one year. This bundle is available from Costco stores, so it's got a six-month return policy to make up for the imbalanced warranties. The system's growing collection of bloatware is harder to ignore. The sheer number of ads on the new Pavilion p6537c-b make the desktop and start menu look like Times Square. On the desktop, there's an ad for eBay, Norton Internet Security (with a middling 180 day subscription), Office 2007 Home and Student Edition 60-day trial, and Wild Tangent's Play HP Games. Under the Star menu, there's eBay (again), an ad for Quickbooks/Quicken/TurboTax, an HP-branded Barnes & Noble eReader app, HP's Download Store (think mall for other programs), Hulu, Pandora, and Snapfish. Last but not least, the floating HP Dock has Netflix, Hulu (again), Rhapsody, Snapfish (again), and the HP Download Store (again). If all of this was eliminated, except for the HP Download store, the system would be better for it. As it is, booting up the p6537c-b out of the box seems like more work rather than starting out on a clean slate. Performance Performance is something the p6537c-b has in spades, at least in terms of multimedia and day-to-day tasks. It completed the Windows Media encoder test in only 41 seconds, which puts it among the fastest in its class. Likewise the system's 1-minute 56-second score in Photoshop CS4 is fair, if a bit slower than the fastest models like the higher-end HP Pavilion Elite and <p>Dell Studio XPS</> systems. The system's PCMark Vantage score of 6,058 points shows the p6537c-b proficiency in day-to-day tasks like browsing, scanning itself for viruses, and office tasks. Compared with systems like the <p>Dell Inspiron 580s</> ($618 direct, ) (6,206) and <p>Gateway SX2840-01</> ($560 list, ), the p6537c-b can hold its own. The p6537c-b's ATI Radeon 300 integrated graphics are adequate for the older 3D tests found in PCMark Vantage, but more modern games show that the system isn't a great 3D game player. Both Crysis (5 frames per second) and World in Conflict (6 fps) at 1,280 by 1,024 resolution were as slow as slideshows. However, no system at this price point with a packed in monitor bundle can be asked to perform well in the 3D tests. You'll just have to go with a more specialized gaming PC, like the <p>Gateway FX6831-01</> ($1,300.00 List, ), if you want 3D performance. In comparison, the <p>Gateway SX2840-01</> has a lower list price ($560), but it doesn't have a monitor, nor the p6537c-b's included 2-year warranty. The Gateway does have a larger hard drive (1TB) and slightly faster performance overall with an Intel Core i3 processor. Ultimately the p6347c-b has to go up against the current Editors' Choice, the <p>Dell Inspiron i570-6939PBK</> ($599 list, ). This system comes with a smaller 20-inch monitor, less memory, and a smaller hard drive. However, the Dell i570 has no bloatware, and sells for a lower price ($598), which ultimately makes it a better buy$250 is a lot of money in this category. That said, if you really want a 23-inch screen, the <p>HP Pavilion p6537c-b</> is a great pick.
