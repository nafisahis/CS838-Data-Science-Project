Just a couple of years ago, thin and light laptops with real gaming chops were just a pipe dream, but the latest slim <p>MSI GS60 Ghost Pro 3K</> ($2,199 as tested) proves that things have changed in a big way. This svelte 15-inch laptop is big enough to enjoy games on its high-resolution 3K display, but light enough to slip in a backpack and take to class or the office. With a quad-core Intel Core i7-4710HQ processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 870M graphics card, this laptop has performance to spare, enough to rival the <p>Digital Storm Krypton</>, the current front-runner among midrange gaming laptops. Well, move over Krypton, because the <p>MSI GS60 Ghost Pro 3K</> is the new Editors' Choice. Design The <p>MSI GS60 Ghost Pro 3K</> measures 0.8 by 15.4 by 10.5 inches (HWD) and weighs just 4.4 pounds. With a black, brushed-aluminum lid and chassis, the laptop has an aggressive look, with MSI's crimson dragon badge on the lid and two automotive-inspired muscle lines evoking the contoured hood of a drag racer. The aluminum construction extends to the underside of the laptop, where you'll also find a patch of suede attached to provide traction when used on a lap and a more comfortable grip when carrying the laptop around. That thin, aluminum chassis did raise some concerns about heat. While running our tests and doing anecdotal game testing, the laptop did get uncomfortably warm, though it didn't hit the 126-degree highs that made us so nervous with the 2014 Razer Bladeit topped out at 108 degrees while playing Watch Dogs. Our sister site, Computer Shopper, raised the same concerns when it reviewed the laptop. The GS60 Ghost Pro 3K gets its 3K tag thanks to the 15.6-inch, 3K display, which boasts a gorgeous 2,880-by-1,620-pixel, WQHD+ panel. That's one of the highest resolutions we've seen offered on any gaming laptop, well ahead of the 1,920-by-1,080 pixel display of the <p>Digital Storm Krypton</>, and topped only by the newest Razer Blade, which has a 3,200-by-1,800-resolution touch screen. The GS60 Ghost Pro 3K, like most gaming systems, does not offer touch capability. Accompanying the display are two DynAudio speakers and a subwoofer, providing robust sound that easily fills a room, and even adds some rumble. The chiclet-style keyboard should appeal to gamers since it's a SteelSeries product, complete with anti-ghosting and customizable backlighting. It has three separate zones, which can all be customized with a full rainbow of color options, and you can add lighting effects like "Pulse" and "Wave" to the glowing colors as well. The clickpad is spacious, but with clickable corners instead of buttons, it may not go over as well with everyone. Discrete right and left buttons tend to be better for gaming, though most will opt for a separate gaming mouse either way. Features On the left side of the laptop, you'll find jacks for a headphone and a microphone, two USB 3.0 ports, and a Kensington lock slot. On the right side is a USB 3.0 port, along with an HDMI-out port, a mini DisplayPort, and an Ethernet port with Killer-brand Gaming Networking hardware, which is optimized for online gaming and media streaming. The laptop also has Killer's Network Management tool, for optimizing both wired and wireless connections. Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi comes standard, along with Bluetooth 4.0. For storage, MSI went a little overboard with three drivesone 1TB, 7,200rpm hard drive and two 128GB solid-state drives (SSDs) in RAID 0for a combination of huge storage capacity and speedy performance. It's a full terabyte more than you'll get on the new Razer Blade, and it's on par with larger premium systems like the <p>Alienware 17 (2014)</>, which also pairs a 1TB hard drive with 256GB of SSD storage. While there isn't much preinstalled on the drives, there are a few apps and programs already on the system when you first boot up. These include Evernote Touch, Skype, MusicMaker Jam, a 30-day trial of Norton Studio, and a handful of trial games from WildTangent. MSI covers the GS60 Ghost Pro 3K with a two-year warranty, a generous offering that doubles the one year that is standard on competing systems. Performance The GS60 Ghost Pro is outfitted with a 2.5GHz Intel Core i7-4710HQ quad-core processor and 16GB of RAM. Mix in the performance boost offered by the twin SSDs, and you have a pretty potent performer. In PCMark Work Conventional, the system scored 2,988 points, ahead of the 2014 Razer Blade (2,787 points) and just behind the <p>Lenovo Y50 Touch</> (3,047 points). Stepping up in performance requires shifting to a larger, bulkier system, like the new <p>Alienware 17</> (3,578 points) which can offer an overclocked CPU without the same heat constraints that a slim chassis introduces. A similar spread of scores was shown in Handbrake and Photoshop, where the GS60 Ghost Pro defeated every similarly specced system and only fell behind the premium-priced <p>Alienware 17</>. But in a gaming PC, processing muscle is secondary to graphics capability, and here the GS60 Ghost Pro delivers. It plowed through our 3DMark tests ahead of other thin-and-light gaming systems, scoring 16,998 points in CloudGate (our 3DMark medium-settings test) and 2,131 points in FireStrike Extreme (our 3DMark high-performance test). At a basic 1,366-by-768 resolution, the GS60 Ghost Pro cranked through Heaven with 78 frames per second (fps) and 92fps in Valley; at 1,920-by-1,080 resolution with anti-aliasing on, it stayed on the playable fringe with 27fps in Heaven and 36fps in Valley. These scores put it neck and neck with the <p>Digital Storm Krypton</>, but the GS60 Ghost Pro 3K delivers comparable performance while being thinner, lighter, and offering an impressive 3K display. Portability is hampered slightly by battery life. In our battery rundown test, the system lasted 3 hour 17 minutes, just five minutes longer than the desk-bound <p>Alienware 17</> (3:12), and nearly an hour shy of the <p>Digital Storm Krypton</> (4:07). Conclusion The <p>MSI GS60 Ghost Pro 3K</> has nearly everything we want in an ultraportable gaming laptop. The slim aluminum chassis is light enough to tote around, while still feeling sturdy and looking aggressive enough for a LAN party. The performance is solid, and the high-resolution display looks great. It's not quite perfectthe battery life is a little short, and the heat issues leave us worried about toasted-leg syndromebut it shapes up to be one of the best midrange gaming rigs we've seen yet. That's enough for it to replace the <p>Digital Storm Krypton</> as our Editors' Choice for midrange gaming laptops.
