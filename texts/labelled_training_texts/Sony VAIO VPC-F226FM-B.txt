Desktop replacement laptops range from productivity-focused systems to entertainment-focused machines designed for media enthusiasts. The <p>Sony VAIO VPC-F226FM/B</> ($1,389.99 list at Best Buy) offers plenty of processing muscle, matching the performance of top systems thanks to its Intel Core i7-2630QM quad-core processor, and pairs it with plenty of features and media options, like a 1080p display, Blu-ray drive, and simulated surround-sound. Design The <p>Sony VAIO VPC-F226FM/B</> has the same overall design as the 3D-equipped <p>Sony VAIO VPC-F215FX/BI</> ($1,799 direct, review forthcoming), in which the closed laptop and lid form two distinct layers, and the screen is surrounded by sharp angles that look wicked cool. The plastic construction is covered with a semi-gloss finish that is silky to the touch and conceals most fingerprints. Under the lid, the VPC-F226FM/B has a black-on-black color scheme, with a semi-gloss chassis and matte-finish keyboard and palm rest. Measuring 1.7 by 15.7 by 10.7-inches (HWD), the VPC-F226FM/B is actually a bit lighter than some of its peers, weighing 6.54 pounds, where other desktop replacements tip the scales at 7 or 8 pounds, like the 7.04-pound <p>HP Pavilion dv7-6143cl</> ($999.99 list, 4 stars) or 8.3-pound <p>Acer Aspire AS8950G-9839</> ($1,499.99 street, 4 stars). The VPC-F226FM/B has a backlit keyboard, with square matte black chiclet-style keys. In addition to the full-sized keyboard, you'll find a numeric pad, also full-sized. Integrated into the raised surface of the palm rest is a trackpad, covered with a textured surface of raised dots. While I haven't always liked the dotted touchpad surface on past Sony models, the VPC-F226FM/B keeps these dots very low-profile, and I hardly noticed them. Tactile details like these can be pretty subjective, though, so I'd recommend trying it out before you make a buying decision. The touchpad's multi-touch gesture controls worked without any problem and the button bar is one of the few I've used that didn't leave me wishing for separate right and left buttons. The VPC-F226FM/B may look good even with power off, but the 16.4-inch high-definition widescreen looks even better. With 1,920-by-1080 resolution and anti-glare coating, this display looks good even in brightly-lit environments. Wide viewing angles also mean that the picture quality is good from the front or off to the side, and several people can gather around to watch, whether it's a Blu-ray movie or a YouTube clip. You'll get some great audio as well, thanks to Sony's S-Force Front Surround 3D sound, which provides simulated 5-channel surround sound. Paired with Dolby Home Theater sound, it makes for an impressive sound system. Features The VPC-F226FM/B offers plenty of storage space, thanks to a large 750GB 5,400rpm hard drive, which is larger than the drives found in either the <p>Asus K53E-B1 </>($770 street, 4 stars) (640GB) or the <p>Dell Inspiron 17R (N7110)</> ($1,039.98 direct, 4 stars) (500GB). The Blu-ray optical drive lets you view Blu-ray movies, as well as DVDs and CDs. It's similarly stocked with a wide array of features: Two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, a FireWire port, and a multi-format card reader (SD, MMC, MS/Pro). Connecting to an external monitor or HDTV is simple, thanks to VGA and HDMI outputs, and you can connect to headphones and headsets with either headphone and mic jacks or a wireless Bluetooth 2.1 connection. Networking options abound, with Ethernet, 802.11n Wi-Fi and 4G WiMAX. The VPC-F226FM/B comes pre-installed with a 60-day trial of Norton Internet Security, a similar trial of Microsoft Office 2010, and a Bing toolbar for Internet Explorer. Best Buy provides its PC App, lets you sidestep the usual load of bloatware, and select only the software that you want or need. Sony covers the VPC-F226FM/B with a one-year warranty, but if you want a little more peace of mind, Best Buy offers two extended protection plans. Their standard two-year protection plan ($149.99) covers the system against normal wear and tear, power surge damage, and includes a "No Lemon" guarantee in which Best Buy will simply replace the computer if it requires more than four repairs during the coverage period. Best Buy's advanced plan ($269.99) also covers the laptop against accidental damage from drops and spills. Performance Sony didn't skimp on the hardware it put in the VPC-F226FM/B. The VPC-F226FM/B comes equipped with a 2GHz Intel Core i7-2630QM quad-core processor and 8GB of RAM. It's a potent combination that will be up to any task you can throw at it. In our PCMark 7 general processor tests, the VPC-F226FM/B scored 2,236 points, right in line with the Editors' Choice HP dv7-6143cl, which scored 2,302 points. In our CineBench R11.5 rendering test, which gauges processor speed, the VPC-F226FM/B scored 4.4 points, just behind the HP dv7-6143cl's 5.07 points. Though day-to-day use will be virtually identical between the two systems, these differences may manifest themselves as slightly slower performance when multitasking with several processor intensive applications. The VPC-F226FM/B also offers superior visuals thanks to an Nvidia GeForce GT 540M graphics card. In 3DMark 06, our graphics processing test, the Sony scored 10,017 points when set to 1024-by-768 resolutionÂ—double the scores of systems using integrated graphics alone, like the <p>Asus K53E-B1 </>(4,950 points). The VPC-F226FM/B did equally well when cranked up to full 1080p resolution, scoring 5,149 points. The VPC-F226FM/B really showed off its graphics processing chops in our gaming tests. In Crysis, it pumped out 58.11 frames per second (fps) at medium resolution, topping everything but competitive gaming rigs. At full 1080p resolution, however, the VPC-F226FM/B only produced 7.9 fps. In Lost Planet 2, the VPC-F226FM/B produced scores of 39.3 fps at medium settings, and 12.9 at native resolution. The VPC-F226FM/B also performed well in multimedia tests. In our Handbrake video encoding benchmark test, it completed the test in a category leading 1 minute 36 seconds. Other top performers, like the HP dv7-6143cl scored similar times (1:37), while the average desktop replacements lag a bit behind, like the Dell 17R (N7110) (2:39). The VPC-F226FM/B showed similarly strong performance in our Photoshop CS5 test, running through our script of image manipulations in an admirable 3 minutes 56 seconds, only seconds slower than the HP dv7-6143cl (3:52) and the <p>Asus K53E-B1 </>(3:51). The only area where improvement is really needed would be battery life. Though it outlasted its 3D-capable counterpart, the VPC-F226FM/B lasted 2 hours 36 minutes on MobileMark 2007, which is far behind other desktop replacements. The 54Wh battery-equipped HP dv7-6143cl scored 3:36. The Acer AS8950G-9839 (with an 87Wh battery lasted twice as long (5:22), while the HP dv7-6143cl, equipped with a 100Wh battery, lasted a whopping 9:13. If your desktop replacement will spend most of its time tethered to your desk, this may not be much of an issue, but you definitely won't be using the VPC-F226FM/B on a cross-country flight. The <p>Sony VAIO VPC-F226FM/B</> offers a combination of high-end parts and superb entertainment options. While the battery life leaves something to be desired, the overall performance ranks it among the best laptops to cross our bench. If you can part with the Blu-ray drive and want to save yourself about $400, take a look at the Editors' Choice <p>HP Pavilion dv7-6143cl</>. If you're after a desktop replacement that offers powerful performance and all the goodies you could want, the <p>Sony VAIO VPC-F226FM/B</> is one laptop you should seriously consider.
