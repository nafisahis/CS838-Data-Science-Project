When designing a netbook for grade-school students, manufacturers tend to take one of two approaches: They create a system that targets a particular gender and age (like the <p>Disney Netpal by ASUS</> and <p>Dell Mini Nickelodeon Edition</>, for instance), or they choose a generic design that is appropriate to any student. Computer Technology Link has taken the latter tactic with its <p>2Go Classmate PC E10</>. The 2.8-pound netbook, based on Intel's Classmate PC reference design, adds durability to help ensure that it can withstand arduous days in the class and nights at homeÂ—and all the perils in between. And that's a great feature, but expect to pay a little more. The Classmate PC E10 costs $449 (direct), roughly $100 more than many similarly configured consumer-focused netbooks. Design The design of the <p>2Go Classmate PC E10</> is far from whimsical, but it does have a very pleasing, restrained look. The netbook is clad in a sturdy beige plastic body that's accented with a darker gray keyboard and a decorative faux-leather saddlebag flap. (The saddlebag accent is attached by only Velcro, and you can bet that kids will peel it off and expose the inelegant Velcro strips underneath.) The E10 has the large rubberized handle spelled out in the Intel reference design but, unlike other netbooks, this one isn't removable. The handle will make it difficult to find a carrying case, but the design is meant to be durable enough that a case isn't necessary. And it does feel solidly constructed. At 1.5 inches thick, the <p>2Go Classmate PC E10</> is bulker most netbooks. That's because its shock-mounted hard drive and ruggedized case require a bit more depth, according to CTL. The company says the E10 can withstand a 30-inch drop (I didn't test this claim) and is equipped with a spill-resistant keyboard for further kid-proofing. The E10 sports a 10.1-inch LCD that shines quite bright for this class of netbook. A Web cam is integrated into the top bezel (it's so small you may not even notice it). Below the display are LED indicators for wireless connection, battery charge, hibernation, and so forth. The adjacent Power button is a bit small for adults but should be just right for kids. The keyboard is 90% full size, yet is very comfortable to use. The function keys are comparatively large and have attractive icons and a pleasing orange-and-gray color scheme. The touchpad, which measures a very roomy 3 inches wide, is responsive and precise. The mouse buttons are a bit springy for my tastes but work well and are very easy to press. They extend about a half-inch beyond the touchpad, which ensures that you can easily reach them. Features CTL is relatively generous with software, although it doesn't add much to distinguish the E10 as a kid-centric netbook. The company includes Intel's Blue Dolphin user interface, a shell that is designed to make Windows XP more intuitive. Blue Dolphin does a decent job of organizing applications and frequently used files for kids. You can easily add or delete folders and applications, and the interface displays larger-than-average icons that provide a small degree of interactivity by spinning when they are clicked. But other than a rudimentary simplification of the Windows interface, Blue Dolphin doesn't add that much to the experience. CTL bundles Intel Education Administrator, a provisioning and management application intended for teachers and school administrators. Of more use to students will be Microsoft Works 9, which provides a decent starting point for those who don't have a productivity suite, and Microsoft Office PowerPoint Reader. Other freeware includes an e-book reader, a PDF reader, and a trial version of ArcSoft WebCam Companion for capturing and editing videos. CTL offers no pre-installed parental control software, unlike more consumer-oriented netbooks like the <p>Dell Mini Nickelodeon Edition</>, which offers a 15-month trial of McAfee Family Security Center, and the <p>Disney Netpal by ASUS</>, which provides Disney's excellent parental control application. That's too bad, because this type of software can help parents manage their kids' computer use and keep them from visiting potentially dangerous sites. Every child's computer should have some type of parental control capability. Beyond a bit of student-friendly software, the E10 has few features that distinguish it from the crowd. It is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor and 1GB of RAM, and includes a 160GB hard drive and Wi-Fi. It has all the usual ports, including a VGA connector, three USB slots, and a four-in-one memory card slot. I don't expect big sound from little netbooks, the placement of speakers at the lower front corners of the netbook isn't optimal. The audio was tinny and lacked volume while listening to MP3 tracks and watching TV shows on Hulu.com. If you suspect your grade-schooler might be careless with computer equipment, CTL gives you an option of three-year accidental care coverage for $130. It also offers an extension to a three-year standard parts-and-labor warranty for only $70. You also can configure the E10 with 2GB of RAM for an additional $69, as well as add a Samsung external USB CD/DVD RW drive for $78, a useful accessory for those who plan to frequently load software or burn discs. Performance The <p>2Go Classmate PC E10</> is stocked with pretty standard fare for the netbook class. Without hardware to set them apart, most netbooks deliver very similar performance, and the E10 was no exception. In casual use that included simultaneous use of Word and Internet Explorer, the E10 was quite capable, with no performance glitches. One vector of performance in which we have seen significant variation is in battery life. The E10 draws its power from a six-cell 47Wh battery that should, in theory, deliver good staying power. In our MobileMark 2007 tests, it lasted a disappointing 3 hours 19 minutes. Many similarly configured netbooks have fared much better in battery tests. For instance, the <p>HP Mini 110-1134CL</>, <p>Toshiba mini NB205</>, Dell Mini 10v, and <p>HP Mini 5101</> have all lasted more than 7 hours. If you're looking for a solidly constructed classroom netbook with a design that's suitable for boys or girls, the <p>2Go Classmate PC E10</> just may fit the bill. Its pleasing, if plain, design does little to engage kids but it is suitable for students of any age or gender. In fact, most adults would feel comfortable using the E10, assuming a big, rubberized handle does not embarrass them. The E10's keyboard and touchpad are outstanding, and CTL bundles a respectable collection of applications (although the lack of parental control software is a bit disappointing). Compared with more consumer-focused netbooks, the E10 is bulky and somewhat costly. But for the price you get a durable netbook built to handle a tough day at school. And that's a feature that just might be a sound investment for parents of netbook-toting students.
