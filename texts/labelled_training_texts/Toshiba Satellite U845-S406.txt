Stop me if you've heard this before: A sleek new ultrabook saunters onto the stage sporting a svelte design and lightweight chassis while yielding decent benchmark scores. Sound familiar? The <p>Toshiba Satellite U845-S406</> ($879.99 list) is about as familiar as they come, comfortably sporting all the ultrabook trappings without doing much distinguish itself, unlike its contemporary, the <p>Toshiba Satellite U845W-S410</> , whose extra-wide display sets it apart from the pack. That said, the U845-S406 is a decent ultrabook for everyday users looking for a well-designed, reasonably priced system. Design and Features The U845-S406 measures 0.8 by 13.5 by 9.1 inches (HWD). Its relatively light weight of 3.6 pounds inches it toward the heavier end of the ultrabook realm, landing somewhere between the <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX32VD-DB71 </>(3.2 pounds) and the <p>Dell Inspiron 14z (Summer 2012)</> (4.08 pounds). Its chassis is constructed entirely out of brushed aluminum and is handsomely decked out in what Toshiba has dubbed a "Sky Silver" finish. Its 14-inch display has a resolution of 1,366 by 768, which is good enough for 720p HD video and looks great, though not as sharp as the as the Asus UX32VD-DB71's class-leading 1080p HD (1,920 by 1,080) resolution. The screen is bright and glossy, so it's not ideal for bright, sunny environments. That said, the U845-S406's backlit keyboard will still allow anybody trapped in dimly-lit settings to work comfortably. Moreover, the tiled keyboard is great for typing, exhibiting minimal flexing and, thankfully, there's also a caps-lock light, an otherwise ordinary feature that's strangely absent in many ultrabooks. The generously-sized palmrest offers plenty of space for your hands to comfortably lounge about on, save for the occasional stray thumb inadvertently grazing the clickpad. The clickpad itself is responsive, with a good amount of tactile feedback for two-finger scrolling and pinch-zooming. And while the left- and right- click buttons are integrated into a singular design, its elliptical markings distinguish both sides, thereby eliminating any inadvertent clicking of the wrong button. Five speakers can be found on the underside of the U845-S406, with two extending up the system's left and right sides. Testing them out with The Knife's "Silent Shout" yielded fairly loud playback by ultrabook standards, though the bass was somewhat subdued. Typical of ultrabooks, port selection on the U845-S406 is limited. The system's right side has two USB 2.0 ports, a multi-card reader (SDHC/SDXC/SD/MMC), and an Ethernet port. The left side sports a USB 3.0 port (with "Sleep and Charge" technology for charging USB peripherals when the system is asleep), headphone and microphone inputs, and a full-size HDMI port. The latter nicely eliminates the need to fuss with any dongles, so connecting the U845-S406 to a larger display is a straightforward affair. Alternatively, you can ditch the cables altogether and utilize the U845-S406's built-in Intel Wireless Display (WiDi) technology to beam the its audio and video to an HDTV kitted out with an aftermarket adapter, like the Netgear Push2TV ($99 list). The U845-S406 comes equipped with a 500GB, 5,400rpm hard drive and a 16GB flash cache, a one-two punch designed to deliver storage capacity without sacrificing brisk boot-time. The 16GB flash cache is invisible to the user, toiling behind the scenes during repetitive tasks and whenever the system is roused from sleep mode. The 500GB hard drive has plenty of capacity, though it comes stuffed with preloaded software. As is often the case, these programs range from useful apps (Microsoft Office Starter 2010, Microsoft Live Essentials) to needless bloatware ( desktop links to Skype and Amazon), with a slew of proprietary software (Toshiba BookPlace, Bulletin Board, Media Controller, and the like) and trial versions (30-day trials of Norton Internet Security, QuickBooks Online Banking). Performance The U845-S406's combined Intel Core i5-3317U 1.7GHz processor and 6GB DDR3 RAM yielded steadfastly average results in our benchmark tests. Its PCMark 7 score of 3,946 outperformed most comparable systems, save for the <p>HP Envy 4-1043cl</> (3,962) and the Toshiba U845W-S410 (4,652). Similarly, the U845-S406 almost always landed in the middle of its class in our multimedia tests. It completed our Handbrake video-encoding test in 1 minute 57 seconds, outpacing the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U310</> (2:03) while falling short of the Satellite U845W and Inspiron 14z (1:58, each) and, to a much larger extent, the class-leading Asus UX32VD-DB71 (1:43). Its Cinebench R11.5 score of 2.41 is competitive, but nonetheless fell far behind the Asus UX32VD-DB71 (3.58). The U845-S406 completed our Photoshop CS5 test in 4 minutes 33 seconds, still falling short of the Asus UX32VD-DB71 (3:58) and, to a greater extent, the Toshiba U845W (3:42). The U845-S406's integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 GPU churned out 3DMark 06 scores that, for the most part, fell short of its peers (5,792 at medium detail settings and 1,024-by-768 resolution; 3,278 at native resolution with 4x anti-aliasing). Accordingly, the U845-S406 trumped the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U310</> (4,978 and 2,672, respectively) but was still bested by most others in its class, particularly the Inspiron 14z (6,031 and 5,510, respectively) and, by a significantly wider margin, the Zenbook Prime (8,627 and 5,148, respectively). Ultrabooks aren't designed to be gaming rigs, so it doesn't come as much of a surprise that, like most of its peers, the U845-S406 failed to breach the 30 fps playability barrier in our Lost Planet 2 benchmark test. Its performance (13 fps in medium quality at 1,024-by-768 resolution) didn't fare much worse than the rest, with the exception of the Asus UX32VD-DB71, whose discrete 1GB Nvidia GeForce GT 620M GPU gave it the necessary oomph to break the 30 fps threshold (34 fps). The U845-S406's 54Wh battery is sealed inside its aluminum chassis. We couldn't run our usual MobileMark 2007 test to determine the battery life, however, so we used a ten-hour video rundown test as an alternative; while this method is admittedly not as accurate as MobileMark, it's nonetheless a useful bellwether for battery performance. Accordingly, running with the display dimmed to 50 percent and Wi-Fi activated, the U845-S406's battery lasted for five hours two minutes, well over two hours shy of what Toshiba claims. As point of comparison, we employed the same ten-hour video rundown test with the <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX31A-DB51</>, which yielded slightly longer battery time, clocking in at six hours eleven minutes. Moreover, a quick rundown to the MobleMark scores of other systems in the U845-S406's class reveals that while it trails the Asus UX32VD-DB71 (5:26, it was nevertheless trounced across the board in terms of battery performance. This is especially the case with the <p>HP Envy 4-1043cl</>, whose time of 7:45 surpassed the U845-S406 by a wide enough margin as to render insubstantial whatever minor inaccuracies that may have flowed from our video-rundown test. The Toshiba Satellite U840-S406 doesn't aim to push the envelope and, therefore, succeeds in delivering a well-designed ultrabook with a good set of features that sports a reasonable price tag. Everyday users looking for a slim, portable system for basic tasks will doubtless be pleased with it. Meanwhile, for power users looking to get the most out of their ultrabooks, the Editors' Choice-winning <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX32VD-DB71 </>is still the system to beat.
