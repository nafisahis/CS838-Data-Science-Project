The <p>HP Pavilion p6787c-b</> ($1,149 with two monitors at Costco) is in a category of one: It's the only dual-monitor desktop system that's available in a big box retail store. People who do a lot of multitasking, especially when working with digital media (photos, videos, music) will enjoy the extra room for toolbars, extra wide documents, or even HD video playback while you're working in the other monitor. Design and Features The p6787c-b is a variation of the HP Pavilion p6700 series we've seen before. It's a tower PC with room to expand, but the looks are a little different. The front panel is metallic gray instead of the glossy black we've seen on previous HP desktops, though the sides are still matte black. The front panel slides down to expose two USB 2.0 ports and audio jacks, and there are bays for two optical drives below the 15-in-1 digital media card reader. On the back, there are 4 more USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire port, more audio jacks, a digital audio port, and an HDMI and DVI port (on the ATI Radeon HD 6450 graphics card). Notably missing are eSATA and USB 3.0 ports, which would be important to a multimedia enthusiast or digital artist since these interfaces are much faster than the included USB 2.0 and FireWire interfaces when transferring large files. Inside the chassis is a decent amount of space, though, some expansion slots are filled. The desktop's 4 RAM slots are filled by the included 8GB of memory, which you probably won't need to upgrade anytime soon. An ATI Radeon HD 6450 graphics card occupies the sole PCIe x16 slot. On the other hand, there are three PCIe x1 slots available, as well as space for two more hard drives and an optical drive. If you're into collecting movies, you'll probably have to install a Blu-ray drive in the open slot: the p6787c-b's single optical drive is a DVD burner. The desktop has a 250W power supply, plenty for the ATI Radeon HD 6450 and a few internal drives, but you won't be able to put a new gaming-class Nvidia GeForce GTX 590 in this system (nor would you want to). So let's get to the reason why this system is cool: dual-monitor support. People that use two (or more) monitors at work can tell you that more than one screen can help the mutlitasker get more done. You want to surf and watch Hulu at the same time? Sure, put Hulu on one screen and the browser in the other. You want to edit a six-page-wide spreadsheet? Go for it. You can set one screen up to be your workspace in Photoshop and the other for just your toolbars and IM program. You can even watch a 1080p HD streaming film on one screen while doing work on the other. So how can you do this? The p6787c-b comes with two HP 2311x 23-inch widescreen monitors bundled in. They can both be hooked up to the ATI Radeon HD 6450 cardÂ—one via DVI and one via HDMI (the bundle includes one DVI cable and one HDMI cable). The desktop automatically sets itself up for a dual-monitor configuration with a single desktop spanning both monitors. That way you can drag a window from one side to the other without losing any image data. You can even leave a window spanning the two monitors, with one half of an image on the left and one on the right. Alternately, you can set the monitors up vertically; so one monitor is on top of the other. You'll need a stand or wall mounts to stack them vertically. The p6787c-b comes with a 2-year warranty, standard for HP systems bought from Costco. The warranty covers the PC and both monitors for two years, software support for one year, and general tech support for the life of the unit. The desktop also comes with a six-month subscription to Norton Internet Security. I'd like to see 12 to 15 months, but 6 months is still better than the 30-day subscription found in many retail systems. Now for the bad: The desktop is inundated with bloatware, those programs that are pre-installed and are limited unless you buy a product or service. The usual suspects are here: eBay, Skype, Netflix, HP Games, Quicken/Quickbooks, etc. Other minor nits are the aforementioned lack of Blu-ray, no USB 3.0 nor eSATA ports, and the fact that the monitors don't have speakers built in. The included external speakers get the job done fine, but they are a little more clunky than built-in speakers. Performance The p6787c-b does a good job on our multimedia benchmark tests, making for a good fit for the multimedia maven. Like other quad-core powered systems, the Handbrake video test takes a scant 2 minutes 38 seconds to complete, and Photoshop CS5 takes 5:14. Both scores are on the quick side and fast enough to keep an enthusiast happy. It will certainly be faster than what you could get done on a nettop or tablet. The p6787c-b's discrete graphics card gives you a little bit of 3D gaming ability. The system can run our Crysis test at medium settings at 28 fps. This isn't smooth by any means, but at least you can start there and dial it down to get a playable number. Likewise, the system's Lost Planet 2 score of 13 fps is just a smidge faster than a slow motion video, but it shows that the system can load games that use DX11 (Crysis uses DX10). All in all, you'll get a system that can get the job, and one that can do the job. Since the p6787c-b is unique with its pair of monitors, we really can't compare it directly to any other PC. We can, of course, take existing PCs and tack another monitor on for a comparison. Compared with one of the HP's stablemates, the <p>HP Pavilion p6751c-b</> ($749.99 list, 3.5 stars), both system's performance is essentially the same, save in terms of 3D where the p6787c-b's discrete graphics helps. Add roughly $270 for another monitor, and the p6751c-b with extra monitor is $1,020 ($130 less than the p6787c-b). The p6787c-b still has a 50% larger hard drive and more memory in addition to the discrete graphics, so its still a better buy (if you're going to use two monitors). The current Editor's Choice for mid-priced desktops is the <p>Dell Inspiron i580-8139NBC</> ($499.98 list, 4.0 stars). Because of its price point and feature list, the Dell i580-8139NBC holds on to its title. Up at the $1,100 price point, you have desktops like the <p>HP TouchSmart 310-1000z</> ($1,159 direct, 4.0 stars) and <p>Apple iMac 21.5-inch (Core i3)</> ($1,199 list, 4 stars). However, both are 21.5-inch all-in-one desktops, which are both smaller and less flexible than the p6787c-b. So for the time being, the <p>HP Pavilion p6787c-b</> is a category of one: The lone desktop that comes with two monitors included in an easy-to-buy retail pack.
