New in Gateway's line of "retail-model" PCs, the <p>Gateway GT5662</> ($750 direct) is available online and in big-box stores as a nonconfigurable, take-it-out-of-the-box-and-use-it PC. It's part of the growing category of midrange PCs that used to run around $1,500 four or five years ago and now have dropped to sub-$800 price levels. Yet you still get one of the latest processors, a large hard drive, and a discrete graphics card. This is a good step up for the user whose needs are expanding but who still wants a reasonably priced system. You can find the GT5662 at stores like Circuit City and online at Newegg.com and J&R. Best Buy also carries it, though only in some locations. The GT5662 is more of a one-size-fits-all affair, and I'm fine with that. It fulfills both the convenience and impulse buy for those who don't want to spend over an hour of their lives trying to figure out what components they need, as they would at a configuration kiosk in a store or on the manufacturer's Web site. Like the <p>Gateway DX440X</> and the FX7020, the GT5662 has a pop-off front panel that sports the Gateway logo and a painted-on "carbon fiber" motif. The case is roomy, with space for an extra hard drive, an optical drive, and two free PCIe x1 slots. Two other slots are filled: The PCIe x16 slot with an Aero-, HD-, and DX10-ready ATI Radeon HD 2400XT card, and the PCI slot with a 56K modem (which you can remove if you're on broadband Internet). Rounding out the features are a dual-layer DVD burner located above the multimedia drive bay, a 500GB SATA hard drive, and a 15-in-1 media card reader. Features that set the GT5662 apart include 3GB of memory and an MCP61PM-GM motherboard with an nVidia nForce 430 chipset. The MCP61PM-GM fully supports the maximum 1,800-MHz HyperTransport link that the system's 2.2-GHz AMD Phenom 9500 quad-core processor can utilize. This enables the processor to be completely efficient in communicating with the motherboard and the system's memory. By contrast, motherboards on other systems, such as the <p>Acer Aspire M5100 (AM5100-EF9500A)</>, can communicate only at 1,000 MHz, thereby throttling the Phenom's HyperTransport links back to a slower, more compatible speed. The efficiency of the GT5662's HT link helps in performance-oriented tasks: encoding, ripping, transcoding, photo/video editingthe sort of capabilities you might have in mind when upgrading to a "more capable" system. The multimedia drive bay, which fits Gateway's cartridge-style removable hard drives, is the same as the one I saw on Gateway's DX430X. It's convenient, though not as much so as the HP Pocket Media Drives. Gateway's multimedia drive is notebook-class, which means its cartridges can fit into a coat pocket and don't require an AC adapter. If the only PC you use is the GT5662 or another similarly equipped Gateway desktop, the multimedia drives are fine, particularly since they're hot-swappable among Gateway desktops with the multimedia drive bay. (You can plug them in and remove them without hitting an Eject button.) If you use other PCs or Macs, you'll find that the included USB cable has a type-A connector on both ends, making the cable effectively a proprietary one. Better-designed pocket drives use either mini-USB or USB type B connectors, which are standard across the industry. If you forget your cable with either of those standard connectors, you can use a cable from your PDA/Windows Mobile phone/BlackBerry (mini USB) or from your USB printer (USB type B). But if you lose the Gateway type Atotype A cable, you're out of luck. Like other Gateway models and their eMachines brethren, the GT5662 is chock-full of bloatware and advertising stickers. One that reveals the system's retail orientation is the "AOL 90 days risk-free with your new PC" sticker on the front panel. There's also an AOL shortcut on the desktop, an offer to sign up with that ISP that appears when you first boot up the system, and an icon on Vista's Welcome Center screen that comes up every time you boot the system (at least, until you turn Welcome Center off). Napster, Office 2007 trial, eBay, Gateway Games (powered by WildTangent), NetZero, Norton Internet Security 60-day trialall the usual suspects are here. About the only truly useful pack-in (aside from the CyberLink Power2Go CD/DVD-burning package) is a lifetime subscription to Spare Backup, an online service that gives you 1GB of free backup. Spare Backup can also back up your data folders to a USB plug-in or cartridge hard drive. The GT5662 is more a high-powered multimedia system than an energy-efficient one, but we ran it through our energy measurement tests anyway. When idle, it consumes about 85 watts, which is not bad for a quad-core system but higher than other multimedia-oriented desktops like the <p>HP Pavilion Slimline s3330f</>. When under load, the system consumes an average of 157Wabout 50W less than its <p>Gateway FX7020</> sibling. All in all, its energy consumption is not bad, but not stellar. Except for 3D performance, the GT5662 is a dead ringer for the more expensive <p>Gateway FX7020</> ($1,100, direct). The GT5662 gained an overall score of 99 on BAPCo's SYSmark 2007 Preview test suite, which puts it in a virtual dead heat with the FX7020's 92 points. Likewise, the GT5662 finished the Windows Media Encoder test in 1 minute 8 seconds and the Photoshop CS3 set in 55 seconds! This is a fast multimedia PC, one with performance that took over $2,000 to buy just a few years ago. Its 3D performance is about the only area in which the GT5662 does fall short. Although the system is speedy enough for light 3D tasks like Vista's Aero environment, and the system's 256MB Radeon HD 2400XT is up to the demands of HD-quality downloaded video, the GT5662 cannot claim DX10 3D gaming as a strength. This, however, is fine for people looking for a powerful multimedia system that saves them a few bucks but don't care much about games. Anyone who needs 3D gaming should consider systems like the <p>Dell XPS 630</>, with its more powerful 512MB GeForce 8800 GT graphics. All in all, the <p>Gateway GT5662</> represents a great multimedia value, with enough expansion room and a strong AMD Phenom heart. That you can find it on newegg.com and in Circuit City stores is gravy. If it weren't for all the bloatware, the GT5662 would rate higher, but apart from that, I can recommend putting the it on your short list of sub-$1,000 multimedia PCs.
