The <p>Getac V110</> ($3,298 as tested) is a fully ruggedized convertible-hybrid laptop with a compact design and a Tablet mode. Falls, moisture, and dust are simply occupational hazards for professionals bringing their laptops into the field, and this machine is built to withstand extreme conditions. The V110 features high-end damage protection certifications similar to the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</> while remaining much lighter (and offering the Tablet mode). With its strong performance, , and sturdy design, all at a lower price than the competition, the <p>Getac V110</> is our new Editors' Choice for rugged laptops. Design and Features While durability is certainly important for rugged laptops, size and portability are also factors to consider, especially if you have the the system around with you. The V110 measures 1.34 by 11.7 by 8.78 inches (HWD) and weigh just 4.36 pounds. That is heavier than 11-inch consumer ultraportables, but lightweight for a rugged laptop, which is typically weighed down by a protective casing and a sturdy design. The 14-inch <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</> weighs 8.8 pounds, and the 12-inch <p>Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme</> weighs 6.07 pounds. The 11.6-inch screen has a 1,366-by-768 resolution and capacitive multitouch capability. It's created with LumiBond 2.0 technology, which helps to reduce glare, keep condensation from gathering between the LCD panel and touch screen, and increase impact resistance. The resolution is not full HD, which is disappointing, but serviceable for the screen size, and it matches that of the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</> (which only has a single-touch resistive screen) and similarly sized rugged laptops. A single hinge at the bottom connects the display to the and allows you to pivot the screen 360 degrees and lay it fully flat against the keyboard in Tablet mode. Pivoting the display is very easy to do, and it doesn't feel fragile or delicate. While the exterior is clearly tough and solid, it's not overly bulky. The edges of the laptop are covered by latched doors that protect the ports from the elements. These snap down and lock into place, and though you might occasionally fumble with one while trying to seal it up quickly, the doors are nigh impregnable once you do. The V110 is certified to MIL-STD 810G, IP65, and MIL-STD-461F standards, able to withstand temperatures as low as -5.8 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The frame is cast in magnesium alloy, with rubber bumpers on the corners, and the interior has been designed to prevent the fan from rusting when exposed to moisture. The back of the system holds two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a VGA port, while the right side is home to one USB 2.0 port, a headphone out/mic-in combo port, and a smart card expansion slot. These are all sealed in pairs or trios around the rim of the laptop, and the left side houses the second battery and a door that gives you access to the 128GB solid-state drive (SSD). The full-size, backlit keyboard includes a full row of function keys, which is a nice surprise, considering the compact design of the laptop. The touchpad is also adequately sized, and tracking is though clicking on the integrated mouse buttons can be a bit inconsistent. There's an HD front-facing webcam and an 8-megapixel rear camera. The webcam's quality isn't great, with pictures coming out a bit blurry, but the rear camera takes good-quality images. For wireless connectivity, the V110 includes dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The laptop comes with Getac's three-year bumper-to-bumper warranty, which includes coverage for accidental damage. PerformanceOur review unit has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i5-5200U processor and 8GB of memory. The CPU trumps the 1.9GHz Intel Core i5-4300U in the much-more-expensive <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>, but that system's Nvidia GeForce GT 720M discrete graphics card is superior to the V110's integrated Intel graphics. The <p>Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme</> also includes integrated graphics. The V110 scored 2,932 points on our PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity test, coming in just behind the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>'s 3,061. It's also on par with the Editors' Choice for ultraportable laptops, the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</>, which scored 2,923. The V110's multimedia test results are also strong. It completed the Handbrake test in 2 minutes 59 seconds and finished the Photoshop CS6 test in 5:27. The <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</> scored 4:19 and 4:39, respectively, while the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> posted times of 2:44 and 4:12. The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> topped the CineBench video compression test with a score of 282 compared with the V110's 256 and the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>'s 253. The V110's integrated graphics struggled with the graphics tests, with frame rates of 11 frames per second (fps) or less on the Heaven and Valley tests at settings. The competition didn't fare much though, and even the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>'s discrete graphics card got just 13fps and 16fps, respectively. None of the machines are suited to 3D gaming, but the V110's 3DMark CloudGate score (4,566) is a bit better than the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>'s 4,393. The more demanding FireStrike Extreme test showed the opposite result, with the V110's score of 270 eclipsed by the 734 of the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>. The V110 certainly isn't meant for gaming—you may be able to get away with running some of the least-demanding, slowly paced titles—but it performed well on the productivity tests, which should be its main objective. The V110's two-battery system holds one in reserve for when the other fails, and they lasted for a combined 8:36 in our rundown test. The identical batteries can be hot-swapped out so that there's always a fresh charge. At 11:25, the larger <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</> handily beat out the V110, though with the latter, you always have the option of swapping in charged battery while the other keeps the laptop going. The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</>'s battery lasted 7:26, and the <p>Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme</> ran for 8:44. Running on a single battery, the V110 lasted 4:10 in testing. Conclusion For a list price that's about $1,400 less than the <p>Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme</>, the V110 provides the same durability and similar performance, a much lighter design that can convert into Tablet mode, and a better . Even the <p>Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme</>, much closer in size at 12 inches, lists at $4,729 and weighs two pounds more. If your business is seeking a well-made and cost-effective laptop to take into hazardous environments or dirty job sites, the <p>Getac V110</> is a winning option with a full feature set. It's our top pick for rugged laptops.
