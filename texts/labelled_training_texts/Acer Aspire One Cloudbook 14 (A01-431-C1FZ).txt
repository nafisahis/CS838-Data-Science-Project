The <p>Acer Aspire One</> Cloudbook 14 ($249.99 as tested) is a budget desktop-replacement laptop that's a lot less expensive than our Editors' Choice, the <p>Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series Non-Touch</>. It's designed to help you easily access your digital life online, and includes one year of complimentary services from Microsoft, such as Office 365 and OneDrive. It's no speed demon, but it doesn't have to be to get you on the Internet. Think of the Cloudbook 14 as an inexpensive Windows 10-based competitor to Chrome OS-based laptops. It's a competent system that doesn't stand out from the crowd, save for its long-lasting battery. Design and Features The Cloudbook 14 has a charcoal-gray polycarbonate (plastic) exterior with tiny, indented dots that give the lid and base some texture, and help you grip the laptop, as well as hide minor scratches. The body measures 0.7 by 13.36 by 9.25 inches (HWD), and weighs in at a relatively light 3.46 pounds. There's no DVD drive, which helps keep the system so slim. It's only about a quarter of an inch deeper than the 13-inch HP Stream 13 (0.77 by 13.25 by 9 inches), and it's thinner by 0.07 inches. The system is also only 2.1 ounces heavier than the HP Stream 13, a difference that you'd be hard pressed to notice, even if you are holding both in your hands. This is a solidly build system, with no noticeable flex in the keyboard, base, or top lid. The chiclet-style keyboard has a tight feel to its keystrokes. There isn't a lot of travel, but your fingers should be able to adapt quickly for speedy touch typing. The one-piece touchpad is wide, and supports standard multitouch commands like two-finger scrolling and tapping to activate right-click. The 14-inch screen has a 1,366-by-768 resolution. That's a little low compared with other Acer systems, like the Chromebook 15 (CB5-571-C09S) and the Chromebook 13 (CB5-311-T9B0), both of which have full HD (1,920-by-1,080-resolution) screens. The display doesn't support touch, and shows a bit of a screen-door effect, in which the pixels are visible in a grid pattern, particularly in swaths of solid color, such as dark blue. The screen is perfectly adequate for Web surfing and viewing YouTube videos. The Cloudbook 14 offers a good selection of ports. On the left, you'll find an HDMI port, a headset jack, the Power jack for the AC adapter, an SD card reader, and a USB 3.0 port. On the right is a single USB 2.0 port, which is useful for connecting a mouse or a printer. The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop, and are adequate for listening to music or video in a small room. Wireless connectivity comes by way of dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, which is better than other budget systems like the HP Stream 13 and the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad 100-14IBY</>, which are limited to 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi. Since this is such an inexpensive system, components are fairly modest. The Cloudbook 14 has 2GB of system memory and 64GB of embedded MMC (eMMC) flash storage. That's quadruple the 16GB storage of most chromebooks like the Acer Chromebook 15, double the 32GB of the HP Stream 13, and much less (though much faster) than the 500GB, 5,400rpm hard drive in the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad 100-14IBY</>. You can always supplement the local storage with an SD card. The system's front-facing webcam shoots in 640-by-480 resolution, well short of the 1080p HD that most webcams capture. That's not bad for quick Skype sessions with friends, but it's probably not enough resolution for impromptu business meetings, if you're away from your work system. Some of the extra software and services bundled with the Cloudbook 14 are quite useful, like a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365, which includes 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage. Office 365 will let you open and edit work documents on the laptop, and the OneDrive storage helps offset the relatively tight local storage. The Cloudbook also includes a few preloaded apps like Candy Crush Saga, Flipbook, iHeartRadio, and Netflix. That's not much bloatware, so you'll only need about 30 minutes to remove the programs you don't intend to use. The system comes with a one-year warranty standard. Performance The Cloudbook 14 is equipped with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron N3050 dual-core processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics. Performance on our benchmark tests was adequate, but not thrilling by any means. The system returned a score of 1,561 points on the PCMark8 Work Conventional test, behind the HP Stream 13 (1,771) and the <p>Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series Non-Touch</> (2,097), but ahead of the anemic performance of the <p>E-Fun Nextbook 10.1</> (1,431). Day-to-day performance is decent, particularly for a budget system. Multimedia performance wasn't great; the laptop took 11 minutes to complete our Handbrake test and 16 minutes 36 seconds to run through the Photoshop tests. That's better than the E Fun Nextbook 10.1, which couldn't complete the tests, but still much slower than systems like the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad 100-14IBY</> (5:30 on Handbrake; 14:00 on Photoshop), the HP Stream 13 (9:50 on Handbrake; 13:32 on Photoshop), and the Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series (5:48 on Handbrake; 8:35 on Photoshop). 3D game performance was in the single digits, so don't think about playing serious games on the system unless you want to watch a slideshow. The one area in which the Cloudbook 14 excels is battery life. On our rundown test, the system lasted 13 hours 59 minutes, making it the leader among budget laptops, far outpacing the HP Stream 13 (9:09), the <p>Acer Travelmate B (TMB115-MP-C23C)</> (7:32), and the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad 100-14IBY</> (6:32). Conclusion The <p>Acer Aspire One</> Cloudbook 14 is a relatively average budget laptop. Its one extraordinary feature is its almost 14 hours of battery life. The Cloudbook 14 successfully leverages cloud and online services for day-to-day use, though its modest feature set and overall performance are commensurate with its low price tag. The <p>Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series Non-Touch</> has a larger screen, better performance, and is ultimately a lot more PC for a list price that's $200 higher. As such, it remains our Editors' Choice for budget desktop-replacement laptops.
