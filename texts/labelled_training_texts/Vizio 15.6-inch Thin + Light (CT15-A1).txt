Vizio has made a name for itself by selling high-quality HDTVs at reasonable prices. With its 15.6-inch Thin + Light (CT15-A1), the company is hoping to bring that same quality/price advantage to the ultrabook market. The Thin + Light (CT15-A1) is sleek and pretty, and its price$999 directis decent. Unfortunately, issues with its keyboard, touchpad, and battery life keep it from being a system we can wholeheartedly recommend. Design and Features The CT15-A1 has an aluminum unibody design, with its mostly silver coloring giving it an attractively minimalist monochrome look and the wedge profile that's in vogue for recent ultrabooks. One of the few touches of color is the bezel surrounding the 1080p, 15.6-inch screen: It's black, but accented with a silver stripe running along its bottom that makes it appear similar to the MacBook Pro 15-inch. Befitting Vizio's reputation as an HDTV maker, the screen is bright and clear; visuals and text on it are smooth, and watching online videos is a joy. Vizio made a few smart moves with the keyboard: The row of function keys on the top of the keyboard default to their more useful functions (brightness, volume, etc.) rather than F1-F12. Users who need F1-F12 can switch to those settings using a utility accessible with Vizio's V-key. The keyboard isn't backlit, but Vizio says it's working on a future version with a backlight. The lack of a backlit keyboard is okay in an ultrabook priced $899 or less, but you expect one in a costing $1,000 or more, like the 11-inch MacBook Air and the <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX31A-R5102F</>. Unfortunately, the keyboard is far from perfect in other respects. It uses a floating key design, as opposed to the chiclet style that's becoming increasingly prevalent on laptops. It's nice to look at, but the flat keys and short travel mean typing can be uncomfortablethe keys have more give than a touch-screen virtual keyboard, but not by much. The touchpad is also problematic. It tends to treat dragging and swiping motions as drag-clicks. The touch-to-click functionality of the touchpad is overactive as well: I found that swipes to scroll text instead selected the entire page. The touchpad also had trouble during the kind of minute movements you'd use to select a small area on the screen, like a checkbox button. The touchpad on a separate, but similar CT15-A2 system also exhibited the same tracking problems. Although Vizio says it's working on updated drivers to alleviate these issues, the latest available version on the company's website didn't help. The CT15-A1 weighs 3.87 pounds alone and 4.64 pounds with the AC adapter. This is very good for a 15-inch system, only a smidge heavier than the <p>Samsung Series 9 15-inch (NP900X4C-A02US)</> (3.6 pounds system weight, 4.3 pounds travel weight). It feels substantial in your hand, though the wedge-shaped cutouts on the sides make it feel smaller than its 0.68-by-15-by-10-inch (HWD) dimensions. The CT15-A1 is thinner and lighter than the HP Envy Sleekbook 6-1010us, which has a lower-resolution (1,366-by-768) 15.6-inch screen. The CT15-A1 comes with Microsoft's Signature prep, which is a service that makes sure the system arrives clean and ready to boot quicklyexcept for a minimum of preloaded Microsoft software: the Bing toolbar, Windows Live Essentials (Mail, Writer, Movie Maker), Zune music software, and Microsoft Security Essentials (antivirus and anti-malware). Third-party software is limited to Skype, which you can find in the Start menu. Instead of using boring plain wallpaper, the system is set to display random images from a Bing catalog. The system's 128GB solid-state drive (SSD) is relatively spacious: It comes with about 77GB free. This is better than the SSDs on the Samsung NP900X4C-A02US (about 53GB free) and the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</> Carbon (54GB free). Both the Samsung and Lenovo ultrabooks came with 128GB SSDs as well, and all three have recovery partitions that cut into the total free space. On the plus side, the CT15-A1 wakes up from sleep almost as fast as you can open the screen. The CT15-A1 comes with very few I/O ports. Two USB 3.0 ports are on the system's sides, one on the left and one on the right. Ultrabooks like the Lenovo X1 Carbon have one USB 2.0 port and one USB 3.0 port, which may cause confusion if you plug your speedy external drive into the slower USB 2.0 port. The CT15-A1 has a full-size HDMI port, so you can hook up the system to a larger monitor or HDTV. The headset jack on the left side of the system supports Skype-certified headsets (including the one that probably came with your smartphone). The system is missing an SD card reader, which means you have to connect your camera via USB or Wi-Fi if you want to transfer photos. Speaking of Wi-Fi, the CT15-A1 has dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, so it's compatible with the majority of consumer and business hotspots, even those using the less-crowded 5GHz band. The CT 15-A1 also has Bluetooth for headset and smartphone connectivity. The Vizio Thin + Light ultrabooks lack Ethernet, however, which may be a problem for some business users. Performance The CT15-A1 proved a mixed performer in our benchmark tests. It completed Futuremark PCMark 7 with a class-leading score of 4,738. This is better than the 2,523 we saw on the high-end ultrabook Editors' Choicewinning Asus Zenbook Prime UX32VD-DB71, because the Asus UX32VD-DB71uses a slower (if larger) hard drive. The SSD-powered <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX31A-R5102F</> came closer, with a score of 4,315. The Asus UX31A-R5102F also shares the CT15-A1's Core i5-3317U processor, whereas the more expensive Asus UX32VD-DB71 uses a slightly more powerful i5-3517UM processor. This is reflected in the multimedia test scores, where the CT15-A1's times of two minutes on our Handbrake video encoding test and 4:37 on Photoshop CS5 are acceptable but slower than those from the Asus UX32VD-DB71. Where the CT15-A1 comes up short is battery life. Its 4 hours 35 minutes on the MobileMark 2007 test is a lot less than the six hours the Asus UX31A-R5102F achieved or especially the 9:37 of the <p>Dell XPS 14 (Summer 2012)</>, our ultrabook class leader. This means that the CT15-A1 is good for day-to-day use around the house, but there are better choices for people who travel often. Therein lies the problem with the <p>Vizio 15.6-inch Thin + Light (CT15-A1)</>: It's not an ideal system for anyone. Its fine screen, looks, and performance are marred by the uncomfortable keyboard and touchpad, and relatively short battery lifeall of which are frustrating enough to make you want to pick up a tablet or another laptop instead. Sure, the CT15-A1 has a larger screen than the Asus Zenbook Prime UX32VD-DB71, but in just about every other metric, the Asus UX32VD-DB71 is worth the extra $300. Another (less expensive) option is our former Editors' Choice <p>HP Folio 13-1020us</>, which has an almost nine-hours of battery life. If you absolutely need the screen size, systems like the desktop replacement Editors' Choice <p>Sony VAIO E15 (SVE15116FXS)</> will give you a more affordablealbeit heavieralternative.
