Curious PCMag readers have frequently asked us: "I need a laptop that looks like the Apple MacBook Pro, but loads Windows. What are my options?" Besides having an uncanny resemblance to Apple's laptop, the <p>Dell XPS 15z (Microsoft)</> gets the overwhelming nod because it's fast, future-proofed, and runs a native operating system that many aren't yet ready to leave for Apple's. Buying this particular configuration from the Microsoft Store entitles you to a few benefits like its "no bloatware" policy. More importantly, the 15z's price ($999 direct) amounts to a lot less than you would pay for the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Thunderbolt)</> ($2,199 direct, 4 stars). The Dell retains the Editors' Choice in the desktop replacement category. Design The 15z isn't an exact clone of the MacBook Pro , although the tint Dell chose for the aluminum enclosure might suggest otherwise; the two systems' silvery hues are almost an exact match. That both machines measure an inch thick and weigh 5.5 pounds makes them seem even more alike. Of course, there are some non-subtle design differences. For instance, the XPS 15z leaves a bit of lip in the back and isn't as streamlined as the MacBook Pro (the lid doesn't close completely flushed against the base, for example). It also has little black feet (or shock absorbers) on its underside, so it stands noticeably taller than the MacBook Pro 15-inch. When last we reviewed the 15z, it came with an awe-inspiring 1,920-by-1,080 resolution, though this option is not available from Microsoft's websites; you'll have to get it from Dell.com, which just reinstated the option. Although this configuration's 15.6-inch widescreen is still a force to be reckoned with, its 1,366-by-768 resolution is what you'd see on budget laptops. The MacBook Pro, meanwhile, ships with a higher resolution (1,440 by 900), and therefore has the better screen. The XPS 15z's island-style keyboard is exquisitely made, and its scalloped keys were taken from Dell's luxury (though now-defunct) Adamo line. It's a typing experience worthy of the highest praise, in part because of the backlights that turn on and off by an ambient sensor that detects lighting conditions, a feature that's also present on the MacBook Pro and <p>Dell XPS 15 (Sandy Bridge)</> ($1,785 direct, 4 stars). The touchpad, meanwhile, is roomy and very responsive. If you're a big fan of dedicated mouse buttons, the XPS 15z has two of the softest and quietest ones in the business. Features The XPS 15z's feature set is comparable to, if not better than, that of the MacBook Pro 15-inch. All three USB ports support advanced technologies: two of them USB 3.0, the other eSATA as well as USB 2.0. The XPS 15z has jacks for both HDMI and Mini DisplayPort (for a dual-monitor hookup), whereas laptops like the MacBook Pro 15-inch, <p>HP Pavilion dv6-6170us</> , and <p>Samsung RC512-S02</> come with one or the other. Legacy users won't find a VGA port or modem jack, however. The standard webcam doesn't shoot video in high definition like the ones found on the MacBook Pro 15-inch and XPS 15 . And although the slot-loading DVD burner is a nice aesthetic touch, Blu-ray drives aren't available yet. (You'll need to upgrade to the XPS 15 to get one.) The 500GB hard drive isn't as spacious as the 750GB one on the last 15z we reviewed, but it still offers plenty of storage for the typical user. Speaker grilles can be found on either side of the keyboard, and they face upwards so that sound blasts directly at your face. It's a better-sounding system than the one the MacBook Pro uses, but lacks the subwoofer that improves bass on the XPS 15. Physically, every inch of this 15z from the Microsoft Store is the same as if you had bought it from Dell's website; even the base price is identical. One of the benefits of buying from Microsoft is that it strips most of the third-party and proprietary software applications that Dell typically loads on its laptops. (Virus protection software is still included.) Another benefit is that the 15z comes with 90 days of free technical support from Microsoft (not Dell) on top of the one-year manufacturer's warranty. You also have the option of turning that 90 days into a full year by upgrading to Signature Premium, a $99 add-on. Performance The XPS 15z is a dual-core laptop, whereas the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch and HP dv6-6171us sport quad-core processors. Despite having two fewer cores, it was hardly a slouch in tests like Handbrake (2 minutes 2 seconds) and CineBench 11.5 (2.53). It didn't beat its quad-core counterparts in many of our benchmarks, but that you shouldn't deter you, as very few software packages will utilize more than two cores. Its 6GB of memory is a nice helping for any system, and enough to pound out decent Photoshop CS5 results (4:33 in our test). In short, it has the kind of power that video and photo professionals are looking for. The 15z also has the graphics chops to take on the most intensive 3D games, thanks to the discrete Nvidia GeForce GT 525M. It cranked out above-average 3DMark 06 (8,610) scores and very good frame rates in Lost Planet 2 (36.4 frames per second, or fps), both at 1,024-by-768 resolution and medium detail settings. Though it wasn't as impressive as the XPS 15 (9,787 in 3DMark 06, 38.2fps in Lost Planet 2) and Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (10,878 in 3DMark 06, 65.7fps in Lost Planet 2), the 15z can hold its own as a gaming laptop. During non-gaming-related tasks, the discrete graphics chip is automatically disabled by an Nvidia feature called Optimus, which lets the Intel integrated graphics take over to optimize battery life. The 64Wh battery in the 15z is non-removable, which isn't surprising as Apple made the same choice to preserve the MacBook Pro's svelte dimensions. The 15z lasted 6 hours 22 minutes in MobileMark 2007, ahead of the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (4:40), HP dv6-6070us (6:16), and <p>Samsung RC512-S02</> (5:35). It even outlasted the XPS 15, which ran for 6 hours 58 minutes on an even bigger battery (92Wh). Although it's priced to move, the <p>Dell XPS 15z (Microsoft)</> is no poor man's MacBook Pro. Its high-grade aluminum enclosure is every bit as luxurious as that of its nemesis, while its parts can breeze through any piece of software—yet it won't cost you nearly as much. Buying from the Microsoft Store means that this laptop is stripped of most of the third-party software and includes free (but limited) technical support—that's the only thing that distinguishes this version from those bought elsewhere. But the 15z is a highly rated desktop replacement no matter you buy it.
