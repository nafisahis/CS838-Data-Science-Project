If you've used a ThinkPad system in the last 15 years, there's a good chance that it was a model from the T Series. The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T450s</> ($1,430.10, as tested) is the latest in that long line that has defined mainstream business laptops and ultraportables. Last year's <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T440s</> was a bit of a disappointment, with its quirky, one-piece touchpad, meager 128GB solid-state drive (SSD), and lack of an HDMI-out port. The T450s corrects those shortcomings and boosts the CPU to a fifth-generation Intel Core i5 processor for good measure. Lots of little details push it to the forefront, like a hot-swappable battery, a full set of ports, and a tilting touch screen. Throw in a very good price, and the T450s vaults to the top as our Editors' Choice business ultraportable. Design and Features The T450s comes in basic black, which works well in a buttoned-down workplace. It measures 0.83 by 13 by 9 inches (HWD) and weighs a little over 3.5 pounds. That's just a half-pound heavier than the thinner 2015 <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</> Carbon Touch, which also uses carbon fiber and magnesium to cut down on weight. It's lighter than the 4-pound <p>Lenovo ThinkPad E450</>, a moderately priced model aimed at small businesses. Other business systems in this size and weight class include the <p>Dell Latitude 14 7000 Series (E7450)</>, another top pick for business systems, and the <p>HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 (G4U67UT) </>. The <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch, Retina Display (2015)</> and the <p>HP Elitebook Folio 1020</> are physically smaller, but still play in this field. Lenovo has tested the T450s to MIL-SPEC 810G specifications, so it will survive high altitudes, drops, wide temperature swings, oppressive humidity, and blown sand. The system can also famously shrug off a can of soda poured directly on the keyboard. The stainless-steel hinges located between the body and the screen look and feel like they could take quite a beating. The T450s should certainly be able to handle your daily office grind. The 14-inch touch screen has a 1,920-by-1,080 resolution and an In-Plane Switching (IPS) panel, which means that images show up bright and clear, with excellent viewing angles. A matte finish quells reflections, and the screen tilts back 180 degrees to lie flat on the table. This allows you to share the laptop's display with a few people seated around a table. Touch sensitivity is excellent. The lauded Lenovo ThinkPad keyboard is backlit and is as comfortable to use as ever, with slightly concave keys that cradle your fingertips during long typing sessions. The row of function keys on the top of the keyboard control multimedia (Play, FF/REW, etc.) and Windows 8 commands. You can switch them back to F1-F12 if you wish. Dual pointing devices include the nub-like TrackPoint and a touchpad. There are also three physical mouse buttons right above the touchpad, which is a reversal from the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T431s</> and the Lenovo T440s. Both of the older laptops have a five-button, single-piece touchpad that was too quirky for many users. Connectivity is much better than average. The power connector, a mini DisplayPort, a smart card reader, and two USB 3.0 ports are located on the left side of the laptop. On the right, you'll find an Ethernet port, a headset jack, a Kensington lock port, an SD card reader, a SIM card slot (the WWAN module can be added later), another USB 3.0 port, and a VGA port. 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0 handle wireless duties. The screw holes flanking the VGA port—and missing from most current laptops—are welcome, as they help keep a VGA cable in place during presentations. There's a docking connector on the bottom of the laptop, and the included 3-cell battery is removable. A second, sealed internal 3-cell battery lets you swap the removable battery out for a fresh one without having to turn off the laptop. This is a huge convenience. Our review unit came configured with 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD, double that of the Lenovo T440s. You can configure the laptop with up to 12GB of memory and up to a 512GB SSD on Lenovo's site. The system comes with Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit) and very little bloatware installed. The one-year warranty is a bit short, since corporate systems typically come with a three-year warranty. Performance Benchmark performance was excellent, thanks to the Intel Core i5-5300U processor with Intel HD Graphics 5500 and the system's speedy SSD. The T450s got a class-leading 2,937 points on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, outpacing the Dell Latitude E7450 (2,681), the <p>Dell Latitude 12 7000 Series (E7250)</> (2,839), and the <p>HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1</> (2,775). The Core M-equipped HP EliteBook 1020 brought up the rear with 1,464 points. 3D scores were very good for the category, and should get you light 3D capabilites for program interfaces and business-graphics applications. True game-playing, however, is best left to a dedicated gaming PC. Multimedia test scores were also pretty solid overall. The T450s took a short 4 minutes 10 seconds to complete our Adobe Photoshop CS6 test, and an equally speedy 2:44 on the Handbrake video test. Those are excellent results for a business PC. Given that the ThinkPad T450s has two batteries (the internal sealed battery, and the removable battery pack), we tested rundown time on both. The system lasted 3 hours 18 minutes on the internal battery alone, and 7:31 using both batteries. We consider the latter almost all-day performance. It was 9 minutes longer than the HP EliteBook Folio models (which each only have one battery), but not as long as the Dell Latitude E7250 and the Lenovo X1 Carbon, both of which lasted around nine hours in testing. The Dell Latitude E7450 (10:12) and the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch</> (11:10) lasted the longest. It's the little things that can make all the difference, and the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T450s</> has them where it counts. The hot-swappable battery, comfortable keyboard, touch screen, build quality, and day-to-day performance are all excellent reasons to pick one up. The <p>Dell Latitude 14 7000 Series (E7450)</> does trump the T450s on battery life and warranty length, but the T450 tops the Dell laptop with its work-friendly features and lower price. Thus, the ThinkPad T450s is the business ultraportable to beat, and is our Editors' Choice in the category.
