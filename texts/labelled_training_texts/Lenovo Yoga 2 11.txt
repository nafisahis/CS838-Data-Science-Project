The <p>Lenovo Yoga 2 11</> ($499.99, as tested) is an evolution of the convertible hybrid laptop, building on the design of the larger <p>Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 2 Pro</>. Its screen swings around its hinge in four modes, and its offers a comfortable keyboard, as well as good battery life. The Yoga 2 11 is the smaller, less expensive member of the family. It's a pretty good system, though there are less expensive choices that do just as much. Design and Features The Yoga 2 11 is the low-cost evolution of convertible hybrid laptops like the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 2 Pro</>. Our review unit has the Best Buy-specific, dark-silver lid, while models bought directly from Lenovo have the option of light silver or clementine orange. The keyboard deck has a matte, light-silver color, which contrasts well with the dark keys on the comfortable non-backlit keyboard. Each key is convex and sculpted to make it easier to type on. The one-piece touchpad is a little on the small side, but it's responsive to multitouch commands. The QWERTY keyboard is full size, though auxiliary keys like the arrow keys, ALT, and CTRL are a little smaller than you may be used to. The 11.6-inch, 10-point touch screen is equivalent to the one on the HP Pavilion 11tn000 x360, though the Yoga 2 11's screen seems a bit brighter. Navigating Windows 8.1's touch UI is a breeze, and since the screen is a relatively low 1,366-by-768 resolution (though typical for its category), you don't need to fiddle with zoom controls to see everything in desktop mode. The screen can flip around on its hinge, so it can be used in four modes. Laptop mode is the standard clamshell laptop orientation. Stand mode puts the keyboard face down on the table so you can use the screen to watch videos with the rest of laptop body out of the way. Tent mode flips the laptop over so the central hinge is facing the sky: this makes the touch screen more stable for extended touch sessions, but as seen below, this mode isn't always necessary. Last, but not least, Tablet mode lets you use the Yoga 2 11 as a slate tablet. At 2.78 pounds, the Yoga 2 11 is twice as heavy as an Apple iPad, but still much lighter than competing touch-capable laptops like the <p>Toshiba Satellite NB15t-A1304</>. And thanks to its smaller dimensions of (8.25 by 11.75 by 0.67 inches, HWD), the system is easier to carry around as a tablet than the larger Yoga 2 Pro. The thin chassis has a dearth of I/O ports. There's one USB 2.0 port, one USB 3.0 port, a SD card reader, and a headset jack. There is a micro-HDMI port for external displays, but you'll need an adapter to connect to most HDTVs. For wireless connectivity, the system has 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, but not 5GHz 802.11 a/n/ac. The screen is rock-solid, so using touch gestures when the system is in laptop mode worked fine. The HP x360's display was less stable when I was playing touch games on it intensely. Lenovo added motion control to the system, but we think that so far it's mainly a gimmick. Waving your hand in front of the webcam gets old real quick and only makes sense when you're doing tasks like flipping pages in the Yoga Chef cookbook app. It's still a little kludgy, so we think motion control is still a solution in search of a problem. There aren't too many pre-installed apps mucking up the Start screen. These include Accuweather.com, eBay, Evernote Touch, Kindle, McAfee Central, Microsoft Office (Trial), rara music, and Zinio. Lenovo also added a few of its own apps like Lenovo Companion, Yoga Phone Companion, Yoga Camera Man, Yoga Photo Touch, and Yoga Chef. The Yoga Picks app is a good way to highlight apps without having them pre-installed. Open the Yoga Picks app, and it gives you an updated list of downloadable apps that work with the system's four modes. For example, it recommends Lenovo Air Hockey for Tablet mode, games for Tent mode, video viewing apps for Stand mode, and general apps for Laptop mode. This storefront keeps many pre-loaded apps off of the 500GB hard drive. The system comes with a one-year warranty. Performance The components include a quad-core Intel Pentium N3520 processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics and 4GB of memory. The Pentium N3520 is built on the same Baytrail architecture as the Intel Atom processor in the Asus Transformer Book T100TA and tablets like the <p>Asus VivoTab Note 8</>. The big difference (aside from clock speed) is that the Pentium N3520 is 64-bit compatible, compared to the 32-bit Atom processors. This is important if you've already bought 64-bit versions of your apps, which won't run on 32-bit CPUs. That said, the solid-state-drive-equipped Asus Book T100TA (2,485 points) and Asus Note 8 (2,402) were faster on the day-to-day PCMark 7 test; its spinning hard drive held the Yoga 2 11 further back (1,851). The Yoga 2 11 shined brighter than the Atom-equipped systems on the Handbrake test, scoring a speedy 2 minutes 5 seconds, while the Asus Note 8 (2:42) and Asus T100TA (2:41) were decidedly slower. That means you can't really do heavy multimedia work on the Yoga 2 11, but you can do the odd photo or video edit, if you need to. You'll have a lot of time to use the system untethered. The Yoga 2 11 lasted a very good 6 hours 53 minutes on our battery rundown test, enough to take you through most of a work day. This is almost three hours longer than the <p>Toshiba Satellite NB15t-A1304</> (4:03), and an hour longer than its closest rival, the HP x360 (5:40). The Asus T100TA was the battery champ at 11:20. If you've been eyeing one of the ultrabook-class Lenovo Yoga laptops, but don't need ultrabook power (and its premium pricing), the <p>Lenovo Yoga 2 11</> is a good option. However, for almost $100 less, the HP Pavilion x360 offers the same internals in a flashier body. The HP x360 is also better connected, with a full-size HDMI port and Ethernet. Ultimately, if you want a highly portable hybrid laptop, the Asus Transformer Book T100TA retains the Editors' Choice; it's $100 cheaper, and offers better battery life and performance.
