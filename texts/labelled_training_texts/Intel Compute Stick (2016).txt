Last year, Intel fulfilled futurists' dreams with the 2015 Intel Compute Stick. While not a powerhouse, the pocket-size, Windows-equipped PC lets you turn a monitor or an HDTV into a large-screen, all-in-one desktop in seconds. The latest iteration, the Intel Compute Stick STK1AW32SC ($159), is an update in a new wrapper, with an Intel Atom x5-Z8300 (Cherry Trail) processor replacing the old Intel Atom Z3735F (Bay Trail) CPU. This Windows 10 PC still looks like a jumbo USB stick, albeit with an HDMI plug, but there are a couple of new features that improve its connectivity. Ultimately, the new Compute Stick is more evolutionary than the radical upgrade it needs to distinguish itself from up-and-coming competitors like the <p>Asus Chromebit</>. Design and Features The Compute Stick is built into a matte-black casing that looks like a large pack of chewing gum, and it measures 0.47 by 1.5 by 4.5 inches (HWD). That's a bit longer than last year's version (0.5 by 1.5 by 4 inches), and a bit more compact than the <p>Asus Chromebit</> (0.67 by 1.2 by 4.8 inches). Other small-form-factor desktop PCs, like the <p>HP Pavilion mini</>, the <p>Zotac Zbox CI320 nano Plus Windows 8.1 With Bing</>, and the <p>Zotac Zbox Pico PI320</>, are much larger in comparison. Both Compute Sticks and the <p>Asus Chromebit</> have removable caps to protect the HDMI plug when they're not in use. The matte finish on the new Compute Stick seems like it will be more scratch resistant over time than the older model, but both have a similar design, with relatively large cooling vents and a prominent Intel logo on the top surface. There's now a USB 3.0 port in addition to the USB 2.0 port, so you can connect a keyboard and a mouse simultaneously. Alternately, you can plug in a USB dongle for a wireless keyboard and mouse, and keep the USB 3.0 port free for hard drives. You still need a wired USB mouse to connect a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse, however, since Windows 10 doesn't automatically search for devices. In comparison, the <p>Asus Chromebit</> looks for Bluetooth devices during its initial setup procedure. For wireless connectivity, the Compute Stick has Bluetooth 4.0 and has upgraded to dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi. As with the previous iteration, there's 32GB of integrated eMMC flash storage, with 19.6GB free after accounting for the Windows 10 Home OS and its recovery partition. While not a huge amount, it's certainly better than the 16GB of storage on the <p>Asus Chromebit</>, and you can add storage via the Compute Stick's microSD card slot (up to 128GB). The 32GB capacity is becoming common on other budget Windows PCs like the Zbox Pico PI320 and the original Intel Compute Stick. Budget systems come with smaller amounts of storage, mostly to reduce the overall price, but it's an acceptable tradeoff because you can supplement the local drive with inexpensive cloud-based storage. For instance, the <p>Asus Chromebit</> comes with 100GB of Google Drive for free, which is a lot more than the 5GB of OneDrive storage you get with every Windows 10 system, including the Compute Stick. Setup is fairly straightforward. First, you plug the Compute Stick into a free HDMI port on your computer monitor or HDTV. You may need to use the included HDMI extension cable in tight quarters, but as long as you have enough space behind your display, the device is light enough to stay plugged in. Connect the included AC adapter to the micro-USB port on the device, and you can then switch it on using the system's Power button. You can also power the Compute Stick by connecting to a USB port on your HDTV, a convenience that the <p>Asus Chromebit</> lacks. The AC adapter that comes with the Compute Stick has a permanently attached cable, however, so you'll need a spare micro-USB cable (like from your smartphone) to connect the system to your HDTV's USB port for power. The system comes with a one-year warranty. Our review unit has an Atom x5 processor, but other versions will be available soon with either an Intel Core m3 ($399) or Core m5 ($499) CPU. Both of these models come with a USB-C port, 4GB of memory, and 64GB of eMMC flash storage. The Intel Core m3 configuration comes with Windows 10, The Core m5 vPro model, which is aimed at the business sector, doesn't come with an operating system. Business customers for that model will need to work with a value-added reseller (VAR) to choose which version of Linux or Windows 10 (Enterprise, Pro, Education, etc.) will work best for their needs. Performance The Compute Stick features an Atom x5-Z8300 processor and 2GB of memory, which helps keep the price low, and the system compact and cool to the touch during operation. The Cherry Trail-based Atom x5 is a quad-core CPU that only requires a minuscule, quiet fan to keep it from overheating. The Compute Stick's score of 1,324 points on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test is on par with other inexpensive desktops. It was slightly slower than last year's Intel Compute Stick (1,414 points) and the Zotac Zbox CI320 nano Plus (1,496). The <p>Zotac Zbox Pico PI320</> couldn't complete the PCMark 8 test. The Compute Stick was at the back of the pack on the Handbrake test, returning a time of 8 minutes 53 seconds. The older Compute Stick (8:20) and the <p>Zotac Zbox Pico PI320</> (8:14) ran neck and neck, while the Zotac Zbox CI320 nano Plus (7:22) and the <p>HP Pavilion Mini</> (7:19) were significantly speedier, thanks to their faster-clocked processors. Both Compute Stick models nor the Zbox Pico PI320 could run the CineBench and Photoshop tests with their 2GB of memory and a 32-bit operating system. 3D performance is good for the category, but that doesn't really mean a whole lot if you're, say, a gaming enthusiast. The Compute Stick returned a good score of 1,606 points on the 3DMark Cloud Gate test, beating the other sub-$250 systems handily. Only the $449 <p>HP Pavilion Mini</> was better (2,814 points). Its frame rates on Heaven (5 frames per second or fps) and Valley (6fps) at Medium-quality settings were practically slideshows, but that's still better than the 1fps that the <p>Zotac Zbox Pico PI320</> fared on both tests. You might be able to play Minecraft on the Compute Stick at low resolution with the Optifine mod installed, but you'd probably be happier playing simpler games like Candy Crush Saga. Conclusion The new Intel Compute Stick is a solid update for one of the smallest PCs available. The 802.11ac Wi-Fi, USB 3.0 port, and improved 3D graphics performance are certainly welcome additions. However, having only 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage, both of which aren't upgradeable, are drawbacks if you're an early adopter who wants something significantly better than the previous model. But on the other hand, you're getting an instant Windows 10 PC you can stick into an HDMI slot on your TV for $160. The first Intel Compute Stick was an Editors' Choice on the strength of its innovation. While evolutionary, we don't believe that the new model's relatively minor improvements merit a repeat. That decision comes sharply into focus when you consider that the <p>Asus Chromebit</> has much of the Compute Stick's media viewing and online functionality for $74 less. True, the Chromebit doesn't run Windows, but if your primary activities are viewing movies on Netflix, shopping for deals on Amazon, and updating your Facebook status, it does the job just as well.If you must have a Windows PC connected to your HDTV, the $199 <p>Zotac Zbox Pico PI320</> is a worthy alternative that's almost as compact as the Compute Stick. We're also currently testing the $279 <p>Shuttle XPC Nano</> ultra-small-form-factor desktop, which shows promise (stay tuned for the full review).
