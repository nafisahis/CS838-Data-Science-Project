The <p>Gateway FX6831-01</> ($1,300 list) comes from a continuing line of affordable gaming PCs from the venerable PC maker. The system has an Intel Core i7 processor, a high-end ATI graphics card, and near-limitless storage capabilities. While you may drool over the $6,000 high-powered gaming systems like the <p>Maingear Shift</> ($6,399 direct, ), the FX6831-01 is more in line with what people can actually spend these days on a high-end PC. It makes short work of our benchmark tests, and it's flashy to boot. The FX6831-01 is what you're looking for if you want a gaming PC that won't burn a hole in your pocket. It earns our Editors' Choice award for mid-priced gaming systems. Design The FX6831-01's chassis primarily consists of black plastic and metal with red and chromed accents. It's identical to the case used in the FX6831-03 ($1,700 list, ), a Blu-ray equipped model in the same line. The exterior design of the chassis is what you'd expect from a gaming PCwith red accent lights that show off the non-functional vents on the top of the case. Ostentatious, but it works. The top of the chassis has an indentation with two conveniently placed USB 2.0 ports for peripherals like smartphones or external hard drives. There's also a hidden compartment on the top of the case for cable storage. The system has a plethora of other connection ports, including two eSATA ports (for faster external hard drives), a FireWire port, eight USB 2.0 ports (including the top-mounted ones), two DVI ports, a HDMI port, and a DisplayPort for connecting to monitors. A sliding door on the front of the PC hides a pair of hard drive upgrade sleds; just pop a new SATA hard drive into a sled then slide the sled into the system for more storage, no screwdriver needed. This space is one of the best features in the FX6831 chassis. Adding another hard drive to the FX6831 takes only seconds, as opposed to the several minutes it takes on older systems. You can also put another SATA drive inside the unit; if you install three 2TB drives, you can get a total of 6TB extra storage. Features The system has a 1.5TB drive already installed, so you already have a lot of space for your games, programs, music, photos, and videos. The system also comes with 6GB of system memory, which is plenty for most users. You can remove the 6GB and max out the system with 12GB, but it won't help a lot. While a user that works with humungous image files or videos may want more memory, 6GB should be enough for both moderate multimedia work and high-end gaming. The FX6831-01 also has a DVD burner; you'll need to upgrade to the more expensive $1,700 FX6831-03 if you want a Blu-ray reader. The FX6831-03's Blu-ray drive and an extra 6GB is nice, but the $400 price premium is a bit too steep. Otherwise, the two FX6831 systems are almost identical. You're pretty set for future upgrades with the FX6831-01.The system has two free PCIe x1 slots and one free PCIe x4 slot (should you later want to add a TV tuner, wireless networking, low-ping gaming network cards, etc.), but it doesn't have an extra PCIe x16 slot for another graphics card. While this is a step down from the FX6800 series, the FX6831-01 makes up for it by having a 750W power supply. If you feel the need to upgrade in the future, you can replace the existing ATI Radeon HD 5850 card with a dual GPU Radeon HD 5970 card or an even faster card in the future. The <p>Gateway FX6800-01e</> ($1,249.99 list, ) has a second, free PCIe x16 slot, but it has a 500W power supply, which isn't enough to power the second card. The one big drawback of the <p>Gateway FX6831-01</> is the bloatware that's included on all Gateway PCs. The FX6831-01 has a whole lot of unneeded stuff like shortcuts to Netflix and eBay on the desktop, Office 60-day trial, and a short 60-day trial to Norton Internet Security. Normally having Internet Security is a good thing, but 60-days of updates is too short. Also, gamers tend to uninstall anti-virus and Internet Security, since it's a background task that can steal performance away right when you need it on the game grid. Even the "Gateway games" are a source of bloatware, as these are just about all casual games that will work on a netbook as well as they do on a gaming PC. They're downloadable games that you have to pay extra for. Last but not least, the system comes with Microsoft Works SE. While Works is genuinely useful, the SE version displays advertisements in the toolbars. Other systems, like those from Dell, come with the full version, which is functionally the same, but without the ads. Unfortunately, since the Gateway is a pre-built system found in retail stores, you can't order a FX6831-01 without the bloatware. Performance The FX6831-01 is a high-end gaming system for a budget price. The system can smoothly play three of our four game tests. It plays Crysis at 1,280 by 1,024 (92 frames per second or fps), World in Conflict (WiC) at both 1,280 by 1,024 (126 fps) and 1,920 by 1,200 (47 fps). The system can't really play Crysis at 1,920 by 1,200 (28 fps), the animation at 28fps is jerky and unplayable. If the animation is choppy you may not see that enemy soldier before he puts a bullet between your eyes. That said, you could probably dial the setting down a smidge and get a playable frame rate at a lower setting. The FX6831-01 is a great performer at our multimedia tests. It finished the Windows Media Encoder test in 30 seconds, and the Photoshop CS4 test in 1 minute 15 seconds. These are excellent scores for a quad-core PC with a lot of memory. Other benchmark tests show similar high scoresthe system's PCMark Vantage score of 8,641 points is close to the top of its class. The system's 3DMark Vantage scores are also quite high: 33,923 (Entry) and 6,693 (Extreme). The <p>Gateway FX6831-01</> has the gaming prowess that you'd need to hone your skills on the game grid. Its Core i7 processor and ATI Radeon graphics card make it fast on the current gaming benchmark tests, and the system is easy to upgrade if you need more performance or more hard drive space. The right amount of flashiness accentuates that this is a system with a set purpose, rather than your standard PC with a high-end graphics card just stuffed into the chassis. A mess of bloatware keeps it from earning a perfect score but ultimately Gateway's FX6831-01 gives gamers a great balance of features for a reasonable price. It replaces the <p>Velocity Micro Edge Z30</> ($1,299 direct, ) as our Editors' Choice for mid-priced gaming systems.
