Updated components are all you'll get with the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz)</> ($1,199 direct), but they can be compelling for many. If you bought the MacBook Pro 13-inch ($1,199 direct, ) last year, it isn't worth the upgrade. But if you're new to the MacBook Pro family, this is the ticket to portable computing bliss. Design Still Tops The <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch</>'s design hasn't changed, and that's just fine by me. The "Unibody" frame (built from a single block of aluminum) isn't just attractive; it's also tough, and its matte finish is impervious to smudges and fingerprints. Similarly designed laptops like the <p>Dell Adamo XPS</> ($2,000 direct, ) and <p>HP Envy 13</> ($1,899 direct, ) aren't as solidly made as the MacBook Pro. Others, like the mainstream laptop Editors' Choice Asus U30Jc-1A ($899 list, ) and the <p>Asus UL80Vt-A1</> ($823 list, ), use aluminum only on the top cover; the rest of the chassis is made out of plastic. A thick slab of aluminum has some drawbacks, though: at 4.5 pounds, the MacBook Pro 13-inch is one of the heaviest 13-inch laptops in the business. The business-class <p>Sony VAIO VPC-Z116GXS</> ($1,800 direct, ) has a similar footprint, but weighs just 3 pounds. The 13.3-inch widescreen is one of the few remaining ones that use a 1,280-by-800 resolution (most laptops have transitioned over to a 1,366-by-768 resolution, or in geek-speak, a 16:9 aspect ratio). The Asus U30Jc-1A has a similar resolution to the MacBook Pro 13-inch. At some point, I would love to see Apple include a display with a matte finish, instead of the lone glossy option, which has a tendency to emit glare. The 13 user experience on the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) is one of the most revered, as the island-style keyboard has since been adopted by many of its competitors. Few, however, have been able to include an LED-backlit keyboard at this price. The MacBook Pro 13-inch's backlit keyboard is invaluable in low-lit environments, and it's ambient, too, meaning the brightness levels are automatically adjusted based on lighting conditions. The clickable touchpad is easily the largest and most multi-touch friendly among its peers, so there's plenty of room to execute all your favorite gesture-based commands. Many have tried to emulate the two- to four-fingered swipes and pinches, with little success. With the latest MacBook Pro 13-inch, Apple added a new gesture, called inertial scrolling: An upright swipe with two fingers can scroll through a long Web page in an instant. Same Features, More Relevance As a family, the MacBook Pro feature set has been criticized for not being as vast as that of its Windows counterparts. The original 13-inch, however, took a baby step by adding an SD card slota feature countless digital camera owners have been asking for. Although the two USB ports seem meager on a 13-inch laptop, Apple brought back the FireWire port last year. A mini-DisplayPort is a rare find on a laptop and a standard feature on the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz). It now outputs audio and video, like HDMI (the previous version did video only). Needless to say, the software bundle included with the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) is abundant, which includes the iLife 09 suite, and arguably the most comprehensive in the laptop industry. As for features on my wish-list, I'd like to see support for Blu-ray drives, but I don't expect it any time soon. Also, an option for an embedded 3G modem would benefit frequent travelers, as opposed to tethering a phone or a USB-based 3G modem. A wireless display solution like Intel's Wireless Display (WiDi) would be a whale of a gimmick, but I digress. And while many Mac fanatics will cry foul over putting Windows on a MacBook Pro, I would love to see better Windows support in BootCamp, particularly with power management and device drivers. Of course, that has to be an improvement in Mac OS 10, since BootCamp is an OS 10 utility. Sticking with the Core 2 Duo Performance is basically a case of give-and-take. While every other laptop, including the MacBook Pro 15-inch (Core i5) ($1,799 direct, ), has transitioned to Intel's newest Core processor technology, Apple elected to stay with the aging Intel Core 2 Duo on the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz). And you'll understand why in a bit. The clock rate has grown from 2.26GHz to 2.4GHz on the base model. With memory, the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) goes from 2GB to 4GB of DDR3 RAM, so there is a significant boost in raw horsepower. According to video encoding tests, the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) beat its predecessor by a margin of 9%. In Cinebench R10 tests, the margin was greater (17%) since this test takes advantage of both processor and memory (video encoding is processor intensive). Against a low-end Intel Core i3 processor, however, such as the one found in the <p>Dell Inspiron i1464-4382OBK</> ($749.98 list, ) and <p>HP Pavilion dv4-2153cl</> ($749.99, ), the 13-inch had trouble keeping up. The <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</>, which bundles a mid-range Core i3 processor, pounded the 13-inch to a pulp in speed tests. The reason why Apple chose to stay with a Core 2 Duo was to take advantage of Nvidia's integrated graphics. Intel's new Core technology prevents Nvidia from playing in the integrated space, and Apple wanted to hold onto the graphics punch that the Nvidia solution provides. And for whatever reason, Apple decided against a switching graphics paradigm, like the one found in the MacBook Pro 15-inch (Core i5) and the <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> (with Nvidia's Optimus automatic graphics switching technology). With the new MacBook Pro 13-inch, Nvidia's integrated solution gets upgraded to a GeForce 320M (from the GeForce 9400M)and the payoff is huge. The MacBook Pro 13-inch's 3DMark 06 scores (5,246) were twice that of its predecessor (2,378), and 3D-intensive games like Crysis and World in Conflict earned top marks in its class. Since all of my tests are Windows-based, the MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) was tested with BootCamp, running Windows 7 Ultimate Edition 64-bit (Results will vary in OS 10). This includes battery tests (with MobileMark 2007), although I performed a comparable video streaming rundown test in Mac OS 10. The 13-inch scored 5 hours 5 minutes in MobileMark 2007, besting the previous version by 21 minutes. Better battery life, though, had a bigger battery to thank (from 58WH to 63.5WH) rather than more energy-efficient components. Battery life improves further if you stay in the Mac OS environment, where power management is fully optimized. I did a video rundown in Mac OS 10 (with an MP4 video file), and the 13-inch yielded 5 hours 18 minutes (bear in mind that a video rundown is more resource-intensive than MobileMark). The U30Jc-A1, on the other hand, ships with a bigger battery (84WH) and scored 8 hours flat. The <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz)</> is a solid choice if you're in the market for a back-to-school, mainstream laptop. Though the improvements are subtle at best, Apple has kept the price where it is while boosting speeds and battery life. It's worth every penny only if you're new to Macs or haven't upgraded in three plus years. Better yet, take a look at the cheaper <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> and bask in all the new technology it comes with.
