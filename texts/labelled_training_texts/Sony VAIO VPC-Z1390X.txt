Those who live in the lap of luxury recognize that they have to pay a premium for true exclusivity, craftsmanship, and quality. As an ultraportable laptop, the <p>Sony VAIO VPC-Z1390X</> ($3,800 direct) embodies all of these things. It's the lightest 13-inch <p>ultraportable with an optical drive</>, yet packs enough CPU and graphics horsepower to rival laptops three times its size. The twin 256GB solid-state drives (SSDs), a backlit keyboard, and a high resolution screen aren't offered anywhere else in such a small package, which is why we consider it one of our best laptops. Of course, no other ultraportable costs this much, either. Design The Z1390X is made up of magnesium metal, topped with a carbon fiber lidsome of the finest materials in the world, though you couldn't tell how sturdy it was by its incredibly scant, 3-pound frame. The metal is hammered into sheets as thin as the magnesium ones found in the <p>Toshiba Portege R705-P35</> ($899.99 list, 4 stars) (3.1 lbs), which explains why these two 13-inch ultraportables are also the lightest. The sound the metal makes when you tap on it truly gives you a sense of how thin it is. In contrast, the thicker, more ruggedized magnesium frames found on the <p>Dell Latitude 13</> ($860 direct, 3.5 stars) (3.5 lbs), <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X201</> ($1,625 direct, 4 stars) (3.8 lbs), and <p>HP EliteBook 2540p</> ($1,629 direct, 4 stars) (3.9 lbs) aren't as delicate. The 13.1-inch widescreen is nothing special by itself, but paired with a 1,600-by-900 resolution, the clarity and vividness of photos, videos, and movies are superb. In addition, a higher resolution creates a larger workspace on the screen by packing in more pixels, allowing users to compare documents and websites side-by-side. By comparison, the <p>Dell Latitude 13</> and Toshiba R705-P35 have standard resolutions of 1,366 by 768. As if this resolution wasn't enough, Sony also offers a 1,920 by 1,080 option, which, on a 13-inch screen, might be overkill. As the originators of the "chiclet" keyboard, it was only fitting that the Z1390X continued the tradition. Though the actual keys are smaller than the ones found in the R705-P35 and <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz)</> ($1,199 direct, 4 stars), there's enough spacing so that the typing experience doesn't feel cramped. There's also a backlit option now, similar to the one found in the MacBook Pros. The navigating experience, which comprises of a roomy touchpad and soft-clicking mouse buttons, rivals the ThinkPad X201 and <p>Dell Latitude 13</>. Features There are some improvements to the feature set since we last reviewed the Z-Series. Mobile broadband, which wasn't offered when the last Z-series was introduced, is now a $50 option (this feature was included with my review system). It's a Qualcomm Gobi 2000 chip, which will allow you to sign up with numerous GSM (AT&T) and CDMA (Verizon) 3G wireless providers. In a situation where you can't find a Wi-Fi or wired connection, embedded 3G can acquire broadband speeds from any of the million cell phone towers nationwide. You know it's a luxury laptop when the only hard drive options are SSDs. The Z1390X is the only ultraportable in the world that uses twin SSDstwo 256GB drives, for a total of 512GB. These SSDs alone ($1,300 option) cost more than the Toshiba R705-P35. On top of that, I can't think of a single 13-inch laptop that bundles a Blu-ray drive, but high-rollers can have one with the Z1390X. Otherwise, it has solid list of connectivity ports, including 3 USB ports, HDMI-Out, and separate card slots for SD and Memory Card formats. It has an ExpressCard 34 slot, if you decide against embedded 3G and opt for an external 3G wireless solution. A finger print reader, which sits between the two mouse buttons, provides an extra security blanket for logging into the laptop. With wireless, it has Bluetooth and uses the latest 802.11n Wi-Fi cards from Intel. Performance What makes this ultraportable special is despite being a featherweight, it doesn't compromise performance. It runs a standard volt 2.53GHz Core i5-460M processor, similar to the ones that power the Lenovo X201, HP 2540p, and Toshiba R705-P35. It's a faster machine than the <p>Dell Latitude 13</>, which had to settle for a previous generation Intel Core 2 Duo processor. Combined with the speed of the SSDs and 4GB of DDR3 memory, it didn't take the Sony Z1390X much effort to blow past its peers in PCMark Vantage (8,736) testsa good gauge of overall PC performance. It also rallied to the top in Handbrake (2:49), Cinebench R11.5 (2.19), and Photoshop CS5 tests (4:57). As if that weren't enough, the Z1390X houses both integrated (Intel GMA HD) and discrete graphics chipsets (the Nvidia GeForce GT 330M), in the form of switching mechanism. That way, 3D intensive task can make use of Nvidia's powerful graphics, while the integrated graphics will help conserve battery life. The Z1390X also has a third physical setting called the Dynamic Hybrid Graphics System, which switches the graphics system automatically by, say, unplugging the AC adapter (switches to integrated graphics) or connecting an HDMI cable (switches to the Nvidia chip). Every other switching scenario boils down to a two step process: Flip the physical switch and wait for a 2-second screen flicker. A three switch mechanism is awkward and somewhat confusing, though, especially when Nvidia's Optimus technologya more seamless graphics switching technologyis already prevalent in many laptops. The Nvidia GeForce GT 330M graphics chip is more powerful than the one found in its competitors. That's because most business ultraportables don't bother with a high-end gaming chips. Its 3DMark 06 score of 6,686 was only beaten by its predecessorthe Sony VPC-Z116GXS ($1,800 direct, 4 stars) (6,867). It clobbered the integrated graphics found in the <p>Toshiba Portege R705-P35</> (1,986) by a three-fold margin, and it didn't drop a single frame during Crysis (35.1) and Lost Planet 2 (29.2) game play. Despite its processing and 3D muscle, the Z1390X performed admirably in battery tests. The 57WH (6-cell) battery lasted 5 hours 19 minutes in MobileMark 2007, which was tested using the integrated graphics chipset. The Z11390X couldn't make it past 3 hours when I switched over to the Nvidia graphics chipset. Five hours of battery life is plenty for the average commuter, but others in this class did much better. The Toshiba R705-P35, for instance, amassed over 7 hours of battery life, while the Lenovo X201 (9:36) and HP 2540p (8:02) took battery testing to another level. The <p>Sony VAIO VPC-Z1390X</> is a unique and unprecedented in this space. Hands down, it's the most powerful and most luxurious laptop in the ultraportable category, having parts that you would normally find in media centers and desktop replacements. It's unusually pleasant to find dual SSDs, switchable graphics, and a Blu-ray drive in a 13-inch laptop. Alas, Sony prices out a lot of globe trekkers who would probably love to include this laptop in their travelling plans. The Editors' Choice <p>Toshiba Portege R705-P35</>, on the other hand, is a more affordable alternative for those who can't afford Z-series prices.
