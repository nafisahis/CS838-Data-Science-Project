Over the past decade, Samsung has made itself a household name in the United States. It's been an assertive player in player in consumer electronics categories across the board, with one prominent exception: laptops. It's not that the company doesn't have the know-how to design themSamsung laptops can be found throughout Asia and in some parts of Europe. But not until now have Samsung-branded laptops landed on American soil. (I'm not counting its slate tablet offering, the Q1.) Although it's entering a crowded space, the <p>Samsung X460-44P</> ($1,700 street) is a worthy ambassador of the brand. It's a 4.2-pound ultraportable with a 14-inch LED widescreen and a built-in optical drive, and its design has an extravagantly elegant feel to it. Not bad for a first entry, though it's not quite of the same caliber as the <p>Sony VAIO VGN-Z590</>yet. The X460 is seductive in both pictures and in person. The lid is two parts brushed aluminum and one part a shiny black finish, combining two of the hottest techniques currently used in decorating laptops. A coat of burgundy red is applied to the aluminum, giving the X460 a distinctive look. It's not bold enough to unsettle business users, yet it's sleek enough to draw in crowds. In a subtle design touch, the X460 becomes gradually thinner toward the bezel. It measures 9.7 by 13.1 by 1 inches, clearly not as slim as the <p>Apple MacBook 13-inch (Aluminum)</>, but it's thinner than its 14-inch competitorsthe <p>Fujitsu LifeBook S6520</> and the <p>Panasonic Toughbook CF-Y7</>. When assessing this laptop's 4.2-pound frame, one has to consider that it houses a 14-inch widescreen. The X460 is lighter than the aluminum MacBook (4.5 pounds) and weighs the same as the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U330</>laptops with smaller, 13-inch widescreens. The X460 is not the lightest in the 14-inch class, though. The Fujitsu S6520 weighs 4 pounds and the Panasonic CF-Y7 only 3.5 pounds (admittedly, their designs aren't exactly trendsetting). The X460's screen is big and bright, ideal for all sorts of multimedia tasks. At this size, however, it would have been better with a higher resolution than its standard 1,280-by-800. The full-size keyboard, which is full-size, is similar to the keyboards found on the aluminum MacBook and the Sony Z590. There's more than adequate spacing between the keys, but the keys themselves are smaller than traditional ones, at 1.6cm by 1.6cm versus the traditional 1.9cm by 1.9cm. (The MacBook's keys are roughly the same size as the X460's, while the Z590's are even smaller1.4cm by 1.4cm.) It takes a little time to get used to this keyboard if you are transitioning from a traditional one, but I found the overall typing experience pleasant. The touchpad was responsive; the mouse buttons weren't too resistant, and their clicks are too faint to annoy the person sitting next to you. Like other 14-inch laptops, the X460 comes with an optical drive. Its dual-layer DVD burner is a tray-ejecting drive, which isn't as sleek as the MacBook's slot-loading one. There are no Blu-ray options like those found on the Z590, but it comes with an HDMI-out port in back. HDMI can be used to stream both video and audio content, such as detailed presentations, downloaded high-definition content, games, or your average Blockbuster DVD, to an external display like an HDTV. Its three USB ports constitute one more than can be found on either the MacBook or the U330. And media enthusiasts have a 4-in-1 card reader, an ExpressCard slot, and a spacious 320GB hard drive at their disposal. What the X460 doesn't have (and the Z590 does) are solid-state drive options; mobile broadband through AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint; or a FireWire port. The X460 performed well in its class. Its standard-voltage 2.26-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 processor is a notch below that of the S6520 and three notches below the one in the Sony Z590. Sony flat-out dominated on tests such as SYSmark 2007 Preview, Windows Media Encoder, CineBench, and Photoshop. The X460 came within 4 percent of the S6520's SYSmark Overall score, and beat out the U330 by 12 percent and the CF-Y7 by 70 percent because these other two had slower but more energy-efficient processors. Aided by its 3GB of memory, the X460 achieved a respectable score on the Photoshop CS3 test, trailing the Sony Z590's 4GB memory configuration by only 2 seconds. The X460 has a considerable advantage over the Fujitsu S6520 and the Panasonic CF-Y7 in the graphics department with its integrated Nvidia GeForce 9200M GS chipset, whereas the other two run an Intel integrated chipset. Though past testing has shown us repeatedly that discrete chipsets fare better on gaming and 3D tasks than integrated ones, these Nvidia GeForce integrated graphics chipsets have been the one exception to the rule. The aluminum MacBook houses an Nvidia integrated graphics chipsetthe GeForce 9400Mwhich has the 3D benefits of a discrete chipset and the energy efficiency of an integrated one. Not surprisingly, the similarly outfitted X460 received 3DMark 06 scores in line with those of the MacBook. Crysis and World in Conflict gaming scores, however, favored the MacBook in both low and native resolutions. Battery scores were impressive. In MobileMark 2007, the X460 yielded 4 hours 27 minutes, besting the Panasonic CF-Y7 by 2 minutes, the Fujitsu S6520 by 42 minutes, and the Sony Z590 by 22. But here's where the Z590 earns its stripes: Switching between two different GPUsan integrated and a dedicated oneallows it to maximize battery life when needed. Although the Z590 didn't fare as well as the X460 on MobileMark tests running its discrete chipset, the integrated one produced 5 hours 2 minutes. The option to switch to an integrated chipset could have benefited the X460 greatly, especially since it doesn't offer an extended battery option. All in all, the <p>Samsung X460-44P</> is a terrific ultraportable that sets a pretty high bar for its successors. I believe its design is a nice differentiator, and a big win given the success Apple, Sony, and HP have had with their recent laptops. Samsung faces significant challenges in the American market, though. Sony has a direct sales channel in the U.S., allowing for more product options such as faster processors, bigger batteries, and new technologies like switchable graphics and Blu-ray drives, whereas Samsung has to rely on Amazon.com, Buy.com, and other e-tailers to keep the X460 in stock. Based on this first U.S. laptop entry, I hope to see more from Samsung on these shores in the future. Check out the <p>Samsung X460-44P</>'s performance test results.
