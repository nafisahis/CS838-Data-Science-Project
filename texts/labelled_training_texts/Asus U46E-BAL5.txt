A fabulous deal on a mainstream laptop doesn't come by as often as we'd like, but when we see one, we shout it out. The <p>Asus U46E-BAL5</>'s ($699.99 list at Best Buy) weaknesses are few and far between. It's a well-designed 14-inch laptop that packs in cutting edge features like Wireless Display 2.0, WiMAX, and USB 3.0. And while other mainstream laptops in this price range come with Intel Core i3 processors and 4GB of memory, the U46E-BAL5 raises the bar with an Intel Core i5 CPU and 8GB worth of memory. Though it lacks a reputable gaming chip, it's astounding enough to replace the <p>Asus U41JF-A1</> ($857 street, 4.5 stars) as the new Editors' Choice in the mainstream category. Design The U46E-BAL5's design alone should spark a great deal of interest. Its aluminum cover isn't brushed like the <p>Asus U41JF-A1</> , <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> ($899.99 list, 3.5 stars), and <p>Toshiba Satellite L745-S4210</> ($639.99 list, 3.5 stars). Instead, it uses a tree-ring pattern that can be felt if you run your fingers through it. There's a bar-like extension on its rear side that, to an extent, masks the big 74WH battery (it elevates the laptop slightly from the back). Along with its brass-like hue, the U46E-BAL5 is undeniably attractive and stands out among its peers. It weighs 4.9 pounds, which is heavier than the Toshiba L745-S4210 (4.5 pounds) but in line with the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> (5.1 pounds), <p>Asus U41JF-A1</> (4.9 pounds), and <p>Sony VAIO VPC-EG16FM</> /W ($829.99 list, 4 stars) (5 pounds). The 14-inch widescreen and its 1,366-by-768 resolution can be found in most mainstream configurations, but it's bright, with very good viewing angles. The <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> uses a glass-covered screen, which liven up photos and movies with richer-looking colors. The U46E-BAL5 has a solid chiclet keyboard, meaning the individual keys don't shift or feel loose when you're typing. It's very similar to the ones on the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> and isn't as mushy (for a deeper response) as those of the Toshiba L745-S4210. The touchpad is as smooth and as easy to navigate as that of the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</>, but the two differ in that the one on the U46E-BAL5 has dedicated mouse buttonswhich resulted in a better clicking experience (the integrated ones on the QX411-W01, at times, interfered with cursor movements). Features There are a handful of features worth noting on the U46E-BAL5. Two of them are Wireless Display 2.0 (WiDi 2.0) and WiMAX, wireless technologies that Best Buy is heavily endorsing. With WiDi 2.0, you can display what's on the laptop to a larger flat panel without the use of a physical cable (Think wireless HDMI). This is the second iteration of Wireless Display, which means the laptop can now stream 1080p video (without choking), as well as protected content from your DVD collection. A Netgear Push2TV receiver is required and a separate $99 purchase. With WiMAX (or 4G wireless), picture a Wi-Fi connection that blankets an entire city. There are more than 60 cities that have WiMAX towers erected, including New York and San Francisco, and monthly rates are cheaper than many home DSL packages. WiDi 2.0 and WiMAX can also be found in the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> and Sony VPC-EG16FM/W. The laptop also has Wi-Fi 802.11n built-in. The 750GB (5,400rpm) hard drive is larger than the 640GB ones found in Sony VPC-EG16FM and Toshiba L745-S4210. One of the three USB ports is USB 3.0, a relatively new transfer technology that's 10 times the speed of USB 2.0a feature you won't find in the Sony VPC-EG16FM and Toshiba L745-S4210. A DVD burner handles disc burning and DVD flicks, while HDMI and VGA are available for external monitor hook-ups. There's a 1.3-megapixel webcam above the screen, and a multimedia card reader that will take care of most digital camera formats. Best Buy also has an extended warranty program, which offers customers an extra year of protection beyond the one-year warranty of most system manufacturers. There are two plans in this extended warranty program. The standard plan ($119.99) covers the system against normal wear and tear, power surge damage, and includes a "No Lemon" guarantee in which Best Buy will simply replace the computer if it requires more than 4 repairs during the coverage period. Best Buy's advanced plan ($219.99) offers all this, and also covers the system against accidental damage from drops and spills. Other special offers can be found online or in stores, like discounts on printers, software, and tech support plans which are available with any new consumer PC purchased through Best Buy. Performance The standout components of this laptop are the 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-2410M processor and 8GB of DDR3 memory. It's impressive because mainstream laptops, like the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> and Sony VPC-EG16FM offer the same processor (and less memory) at higher premiums. Granted, the extra memory didn't blow away the competition in Photoshop CS5 tests (4 minutes 10 seconds), but for those who use virtualization and run huge databases, the extra memory will come in very handy. The U46E-BAL5's Handbrake (1:53) and Cinebench R11.5 (2.59) scores are among the best in breed, although the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> (1:59 in Handbrake, 2.56 in Cinebench) and VPC-EG16FM (2:05 in Handbrake, 2.6 in Cinebench) didn't trail by much. Gaming, according to our 3DMark 06 test (5,085), is the only area where its predecessor, the <p>Asus U41JF-A1</> (8,189), had the overwhelming advantage. Packing a huge 74WH battery was necessary to counter the draining effects of the Core i5 processor. Even though its 7 hours 19 minute score on MobileMark 2007 was an hour behind than the <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> (8:48) and Sony VPC-EF16FM (8:12), it's still a great deal of battery lifeenough for a cross-country flight and then some. Mainstream laptops win awards by delivering all the goods at an almost unbelievable price. The <p>Asus U46E-BAL5</> is equipped with a powerful Core i5 processor and maxes out its memory banks, while throwing in Easter eggs like WiDi 2.0, WiMAX, and USB 3.0. It also sports an attractive exterior, which is just as important. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal than this. As such, it's our new Editors' Choice for mainstream lapotops.
