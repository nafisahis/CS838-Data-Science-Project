The 2015 <p>Getac F110 </>($2,099 as tested) is a rugged Windows tablet that's built to take all sorts of punishment without succumbing to such hazards as moisture, temperature extremes, or even just the bangs and bashes experienced in the back of a fast- moving truck. The F110 (2015) is the latest version of the <p>Getac F110 </>tablet we tested a year ago, and the new model steps up the performance, the battery life, and the affordability. The lower price makes this an especially enticing system, and with its other improvements, it makes an easy pick as our Editors' Choice rugged Windows tablet, replacing the <p>Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1</>. Design and Features We praised the original <p>Getac F110 </>we reviewed for being one of the thinnest and lightest rugged tablets on the market, and that's still the case, thanks to a chassis design that is largely unchanged from the previous model. The F110 measures 0.96 by 12.3 by 8.15 inches (HWD), and weighs just 3.1 pounds. Compared with a regular, non-rugged, enterprise tablet, like the 1.6-pound <p>Dell Venue 11 Pro 7000 Series (7140)</>, it's thick and heavy, but it's no heavier than last year's <p>Getac F110 </>(3.1 pounds). Weighed against a convertible rugged laptop, like the <p>Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme</> (6.07 pounds), it's a featherweight. That's worth keeping in mind when comparing a standalone tablet to a convertible laptop with tablet capability. The tablet also built like a tank, with ruggedized features galore. At each corner is a rubber bumper, protecting the system against drops. The ports are all sealed off in one way or another, be it behind a locking hatch (like the USB 3.0 port, the HDMI port, and the audio jack on the left side of the machine), or a cover to seal out dirt and moisture from a single connection, like the one for power, which sports a rubber-stopper-style plug. An expansion module can also be added for extra functionality, like a barcode reader, dedicated GPS, or 4G LTE mobile broadband (all optional, but available for custom configurations). Fashioned out of magnesium alloy and stout Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic, the tablet is made to withstand vibrations, drops and shocks, extremes in temperature, and heavy humidity, meeting certification standards for MIL-STD 801G and IP65 ruggedness. The 11.6-inch display offers basic HD (1,366-by-768) resolution, but it ramps up the brightness to 800 nits for readability, even in direct sunlight. You can read from the screen better under bright light than most tablets we've seen. Viewing angles aren't as impressive. Even tilting the tablet slightly away from me caused a very noticeable negative effect. You expect a tablet to include touch capability, but the F110 steps it up further with 10-finger touch for both hands and gloved fingers. An included stylus is also available for tapping and swiping, and can be stowed in a built-in storage slot on the back of the tablet when not in use. The F110 has no physical keyboard, but typing and handwriting capture are available with onscreen inputs. There are a few physical buttons on the tablet. On the right-hand bezel, you'll find a Power button, an On/Off button for touch input, one programmable button, and two buttons for volume and brightness control. On the bottom bezel is a physical Windows button. Along the bottom edge of the tablet is a docking connector for use with the various docking accessories offered by Getac. The tablet is equipped with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, with several optional features, ranging from dedicated GPS and 4G LTE mobile broadband to integrated fingerprint reader and contactless smart card reader. For storage, our review was outfitted with a 128GB solid-state drive (SSD). Getac covers the F110 with a three-year warranty. Performance The F110 boasts a 2.2GHz Intel Core i5-5200U processor, which our review unit has paired with 4GB of RAM (the tablet can be outfitted with up to 8GB). In the wildly varied world of Windows tablets, that's one of the more powerful processors available, since tablets have been made with everything from Intel's Atom chips to the mobile-friendly Intel Core M, to the ultrabook-class processor used here. With that processor and RAM, the F110 scored 2,942 points in PCMark 8 Work Conventional. While not all of our comparison units were tested under the same set of benchmark tests, this score does put the F110 ahead of the <p>Dell Venue 11 Pro 7000 Series (7140)</> (2,586 points) and the <p>Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1</> (1,470 points), indicating the tablet should be able to handle all sorts of uses, with full software support. Despite the lead in PCMark 8, the F110 lingered toward the back of the bunch in Photoshop CS6 tests, finishing in 6 minutes 28 seconds, falling behind the Editors' Choice Panasonic FZ-G1 (5:44) and the previous, Core-i7-equipped <p>Getac F110 </>(4:37). Some processor-intensive tasks may run a bit slowly, but they will still run—something that can't always be said of systems using Atom processors. The F110 is built to withstand punishing circumstances, but those aren't all environmental threats—sometimes the biggest enemy of mobile computing is time, and the usable limits of battery life. To keep the tablet running without interruption for hours or even days on end, the F110 has two identical, hot-swappable batteries, which can be pulled out independently to recharge and continue use for as long as is necessary. Each battery provides about 4 and a half hours of use on its own (tested at 4:28 and 4:36, respectively), but they are meant to be used together. The two batteries together lasted 9:14 in our battery rundown test, nearly an hour-and-a-half longer than the same setup in the previous iteration (7:38). For rugged systems, that's a solid lead—the Panasonic FZ-M1 lasted only 5:04, while the Panasonic FZ-G1 petered out at 6:06 in the same test. If longevity alone is your prime concern, however, the non-rugged <p>Dell Venue 11 Pro 7000 Series (7140)</> lasted 9:41 with its basic battery, and 15:58 with a secondary battery in a docking keyboard. Conclusion When you need a tablet that will survive the harshest of environments, whether it's an archeological dig in the desert or disaster recovery in the islands, or even if it's just a local construction site, the <p>Getac F110 (2015)</> is an excellent option. Performance is good, thanks to an Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB hard drive, and there's no arguing with the price, matching the competition feature for feature, while saving you hundreds of dollars. Wherever you do your work, the <p>Getac F110 (2015)</> is the rugged Windows tablet to take with you, and our Editors' Choice.
