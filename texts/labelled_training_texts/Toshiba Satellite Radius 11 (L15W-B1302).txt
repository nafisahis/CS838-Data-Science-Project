Looking for an inexpensive laptop that doubles as a tablet? There are plenty of systems to choose from. The Satellite Radius 11 (L15W-B1302) ($349.99, exclusively at Best Buy) is Toshiba's entry in the growing category of small, inexpensive convertible-hybrid laptops similar in design to the Lenovo Yoga line. While it's a decent performer and affordable option for multimode laptops, there are plenty of other laptop and tablet hybrids to choose from that offer a better overall package, like the Editors' Choice <p>Asus Transformer Book T100TA (64GB)</>. Design Like other 2-in-1 designs, the Radius 11 offers both laptop and tablet functionality. Instead of a detachable docking tablet, the laptop hinge allows the screen to be folded back into other positions. The modes include Laptop, Tablet, Tabletop (folded flat), Presentation (propped up like a tent), and Audience (touch screen shown with keyboard folded back as a base). Lenovo was there first with the dual-hinge design, as seen on the <p>Lenovo Yoga 2 11</>, but we've also seen the <p>HP Pavilion 11t-n000 x360</> and the <p>Dell XPS 11</> doing their best interpretations, making it a crowded category. When closed, the Radius 11 measures 0.86 by 11.4 by 7.8 inches (HWD), and weighs 2.9 pounds. The 11-inch form factor works well as both a highly portable laptop and a tablet that can easily be carried and used on the go. The small size and sleek design owe a lot to the Intel Celeron processor inside, which doesn't require the same sort of cooling and battery power as an Intel Core i3 or Core i5 laptop CPU. Intel has recently introduced the much-more-capable Intel Core M (seen recently in the <p>Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro</>), which offers better performance with the same sort of energy efficiency and fanless cooling, but it's not something you're likely to see in this price range. The 11.6-inch screen works for both laptop and tablet use. The 1,366-by-768 resolution isn't anything special, but the display is reasonably bright and clear, with 10-finger touch support and edge-to-edge glass. The laptop keyboard has a basic chiclet-style design, with black square keys but no backlight, so using the keyboard in a dimly lit environment might be a pain. When you fold back the display, the keyboard is automatically disengaged, and automatic screen rotation is turned on. The accompanying touchpad is squarely centered in the palm rest, and while it offers the multitouch gesture support you'll want for Windows 8, it also has separate clickable right and left buttons. Features Past its multimode design, the Radius 11 has a fairly standard feature set, with the ports located along both sides of the laptop chassis. On the right are a USB 2.0 port and a headset jack, along with a Kensington lock slot and physical buttons for volume control. On the left are a full-size HDMI-out port, a USB 3.0 port, and an SD card slot, along with a power connector and an On/Off button. Inside the system is equipped with 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, and WiDi wireless video streaming. For storage the Radius 11 boasts a 500GB hard drive, much like the <p>Lenovo Yoga 2 11</> and the <p>HP Pavilion 11t-n000 x360</>, but much larger than the 64GB solid-state drives (SSD) offered in tablets like the <p>Acer Aspire Switch 10</> and the Asus Transformer Book T100TA. With so much storage space, Toshiba doesn't hold back on the preinstalled software. There are 30-day trials of McAfee Live Safe 2014 and Microsoft Office 365. There are also free services, like Adobe Reader, Google Drive, Amazon Kindle reader and others. Then there are retail apps (Amazon, Ebay), entertainment apps (Netflix, Hulu Plus, Spotify, iHeart Radio), and samples of about a dozen games from WildTangent. Toshiba also throws in several branded apps, like App Place, BookPlace, Media Player by sMedio Truelink+, and more utilities for system recovery, password management, and power management. Toshiba covers the Radius 11 with a 1-year warranty. Performance The Satellite Radius 11 is outfitted with an Intel Celeron N2840 processor and 4GB of RAM. This is fairly similar to the <p>Acer Aspire E3-111-C1BW</>, which also boasts a Celeron CPU and 4GB of memory, and like that system, the Satellite Radius 11 didn't wow me with its performance during testing. It's functional, but noticeably slow, even when performing very basic tasks, like opening a new browser tab. It will do for things as simple as typing up papers or checking email and Facebook, but most other tasks will be laggy. In PCMark 8, the Radius 11 scored 1,627 points, ahead of both the Acer E3-111-C1BW laptop (1,605 points) and the Acer Switch 10 detachable-hybrid tablet (1,576 points). In Photoshop, the Radius 11 was actually faster (13 minutes 34 seconds) than the <p>Acer Aspire E3-111-C1BW</> (15:04), the <p>HP Pavilion 11t-n000 x360</> (15:59), and the <p>Lenovo Yoga 2 11</> (16:08), but that's a contrast between slow and slower. The <p>Dell XPS 11</> had the best time by a wide margin on Photoshop (6:50), thanks to its significantly more powerful Intel Core i5 processor. Battery life is actually a bit short on the Radius 11, lasting just 5 hours 17 minutes on our battery rundown test. The Acer T100TA more than doubled that (11:20), but even among more similar systems, like the <p>Lenovo Yoga 2 11</>(6:53), <p>HP Pavilion 11t-n000 x360</> (5:40), and the <p>Dell XPS 11</> (5:55) the Radius 11 lingers at the back of the crowd. Conclusion Looking at the performance, the <p>Toshiba Satellite Radius 11 (L15W-B1302)</> isn't particularly impressive, yet it still may be the best of the entry-level convertible-hybrid systems we've seen. It certainly leads the growing crowd of dual-hinge convertibles, though the Editors' Choice Asus Transformer Book T100TA, offers a better overall package, most notably in terms of battery life. At this price point, however, I'm strongly inclined to recommend a Chromebook over the majority of budget-friendly Windows systems, as the Chrome OS offers a better performance when paired with low-power processors. Our top pick for Wi-Fi-only Chromebooks is the Editors' Choice <p>Acer Chromebook C720P-2600</>, which offers a slim design and touch screen, but for those who want a convertible design, there's also the highly recommended <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e Chromebook</>.
