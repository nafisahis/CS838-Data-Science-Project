The <p>Dell Vostro 460</> ($1,163 direct; $1,393 with 22-inch monitor) is a bridge unit between the consumer world and the business world: It has some of the benefits you'll find in consumer-grade desktop PCs, like its Intel Core i7-2600 processor, but otherwise the Vostro is all business. It's designed for companies without a dedicated IT department, and it's a far better solution than simply dropping a powerful consumer PC in your office. The <p>Dell Vostro 460</> is the SMB system to buy if you need more power than our Editors' Choice <p>HP Compaq 4000 Pro</> ($549 direct, 4.5 stars), which is best suited for clerical tasks. Design and Features The Vostro 460 sports a fairly standard minitower chassis, which is distinct and angular enough to look current, though it lacks the unique design that characterizes Dell's XPS line. (The Vostro 460 is a business PC, after all.) For a measure of physical security, the Vostro has a simple cable pass-through hole molded into the case door to help prevent people from opening the chassis. There's also plenty of internal expansion room, as well as a multitude of external I/O ports. You'll need a screwdriver to open the case and upgrade the internal hard drive or add a second in the single free bay, but the PCI Express (PCIe) card slots are tool-less. An optical bay, two DIMM slots, a PCIe x16 graphics card slot, and one PCIe x1 card slot are empty for your use; a second PCIe x1 slot is occupied by the system's USB 3.0 card, which gives you extra-fast data transfers at both the back and front of your computer (the latter by way of an internal connection to a front-panel port). The other track star of I/O, eSATA, is also present with a powered port on the rear panel. USB 3.0 is theoretically faster (5Gbps versus 3Gbps), but the port is nice for power users who already own eSATA drives. The Vostro 460 also has other ports, including eight USB 2.0 ports, S/PDIF (digital audio), analog audio, and HDMI out in addition to VGA. You should be able to hook up almost any business or consumer devices to this system, including smartphones, tablets, external hard drives, and scanners. About the only things you can't connect are old-school serial devices (like some bar code readers and older PDAs). If you still use those products, Dell continues to offer serial ports on enterprise-class machines like the Dell Optiplex 780 Ultra Small Form Factor ($1,484 direct, 4 stars). Dell has added no bloatware to the Vostro 460a good thing, as business users don't need systems to lock up at critical moments because some random piece of software is consuming memory or system resources. The Vostro 460 comes with a selection of Dell support programs, as well as a Dell support system for small business users the company promises will help end users and small-shop IT guys diagnose and fix problems. Unfortunately, the system only comes with one year of basic support, and an upgrade to three years of Pro-level support for faster turnaround and on-site service costs $113 more. At least the support is 24/7. The Vostro 460 comes with a 500GB 7,200rpm SATA hard drive, which should be plenty for all but the most information-intensive businesses. To put that into perspective, 500GB can hold over 100 DVDs worth of data, or over 100,000 MP3s. If you need more space, there's the internal drive bay or the external ports for more storage. The Vostro 460 comes with 4GB of DDR3 memory, with space for up to 8GB more; swap the existing memory out, and you can max out the system at 16GB. 4GB is plenty for most business users, especially if you're only planning to use the system for ordering and bookkeeping. The monitor Dell sent us with the Vostro 460 was a full HD 16:9 monitor, operating at 1,920-by-1,080 resolution, matching the screen size of your average 1080p HD online video. Performance The <p>Dell Vostro 460</> comes with a second-generation Intel Core i7-2600 processor, a quad-core CPU that supports Turbo Boost. That means it can temporarily overclock itself from 3.4GHz to 3.8GHz in times of need, such as when you need to do a quick Excel calculation, upload your sales video to YouTube, or retouch a photo to remove an annoying tree branch from the real-estate picture you just took. Thanks to that Core i7-2600 processor, the Vostro 460 has workstation-class performance. And if you still depend on programs that only work in Windows XP, Virtual PC XP mode will let you use them with a minimum of fuss. The Vostro 460 completed our Handbrake video test in 1 minute 36 seconds and Photoshop CS5 test in 2:54. These times are amazing, as the much more expensive <p>HP Z210 Small Form Factor Workstation</> ($2,173 direct, 4 stars) needed 1:32 and 3:04, respectivelythis shows the power of the Core i7-2600 processor versus the Xeon E3-1245. The Vostro 460 is also faster than the king of all-in-one PCs, the <p>Apple iMac 21.5-inch (Thunderbolt)</> ($1,199 list, 4.5 stars), which took a bit longer on both tests (1:56 on Handbrake, 3:29 on CS5). The Vostro 460 gained further coin by earning an excellent 10,286 on Futuremark's PCMark Vantagethis score is much higher than the iMac (8,141) or other mid-priced systems. (See the benchmark table for more). Probably the best system to compare with the <p>Dell Vostro 460</> is the iMac 21.5-inch, since both have 21- or 22-inch monitors, high-end quad-core processors, and are both in the $1,200-$1,500 price range. The Dell is a more powerful multimedia system, and has the benefit of running Windows programs out of the box. Let's face it: Though the Mac is Windows compatible, you still have to buy a copy of Microsoft's OS for it, and there are fewer Mac OS business programs out there. The Mac, however, is a better 3D performer, and more svelte. You may be tempted to buy a consumer-grade system like the <p>Dell XPS x8300-5215NBK</> ($1,099.99 list, 4 stars), but don't do it. The x8300-5215NBK has the same Core i7-2600 processor and even higher-end 3D graphics, but you're not buying a business PC to play games, and you'll give up the business-oriented Vostro support. The <p>HP Compaq 4000 Pro</> hangs on as our SMB Editors' Choice by virtue of its extremely low price, but if you find yourself needing more power, captain, then we highly recommend taking a look at the <p>Dell Vostro 460</>.
