Anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive entertainment laptop is going to be thrilled with what the <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4165dx</> ($779.99 list at Best Buy) has to offer. Not only does it have a big and bright 17.3-inch display and a great sounding speaker system that includes a subwoofer, but it also comes with a Blu-ray drive for HD movie enjoyment. Adding to its appeal is a battery life of over 7 hoursmeaning you could easily watch up to three or four movies in a row. But the dv7-4165dx has one significant Achilles' Heel and that is poor overall application performance, compared to other similarly-priced desktop replacement laptops. Design On the outside, it's not easy to tell the dv7-4165dx apart from other recent HP dv7 models, such as the Editors' Choice <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4083cl</> ($999.99 list, 4 stars)the internal components, however, are another matter altogether. The sturdy brushed aluminum body features a laser-etched design running across the lid and palm rest, while the bare keyboard deck offers a stylish contrast against the black, chiclet-style keyboard and dedicated number pad. The keys have some flex to them, but nothing egregious. The single-piece touchpad has generous proportions at 5-inches (diagonal), but I found the buttons hidden beneath the pad a bit on the stiff side and therefore sometimes difficult to press. The only thing you'll find above the keyboard is the solitary power button, and to the right of the touchpad is lone fingerprint reader. Weighing in at 6.87 pounds, the dv7-4165dx is on the heavy side for a 17.3-inch laptop. The <p>Toshiba Satellite L675D-S7052</> ($649.99 list, 2.5 stars) comes in at a much lighter 5.95 pounds and the <p>Dell Inspiron 17R-2248MRB</> ($849.99 list, 3.5 stars) is a tad lighter at 6.7 pounds. That said, the HP dv7-4083cl manages to tip the scales at 7 pounds. In the case of the dv7-4165dx and HP dv7-4083cl models, at least some of the extra weight can be attributed to the extended-life batteries they come with. The large battery also expands the backend of the dv7-4165dx to be 2.1 inches thick. Features Other than falling prey to reflections, the 17.3-inch widescreen display is perfect for watching movies. The screen is bright and displays crisp colors. With a native resolution of 1,600 by 900, you'll be able to watch 720p HD videos, but you won't be able to enjoy 1080p videos in their full native resolution. This is shame, because the dv7-4165dx comes with a DVD±RW DL/BD-ROM combo drive that is capable of playing Blu-ray movies. Movies, as well as all other types of audio, sound great booming from the dv7-4165dx's speakers. Not only can the speakers get pretty loud, but they also crank out halfway-decent bass response, thanks to the subwoofer located on the underside of the laptop. Whereas most desktop replacements at this price point top out with 500GB hard drives, the dv7-4165dx comes with a spacious 640GB hard drive (the dv7-4083cl comes with a 500GB drive). The rest of the dv7-4165dx's feature set is also generous, with VGA and HMDI ports, an 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi radio, a Gigabit Ethernet port, 3 USB 2.0 ports, one eSATA/USB combo port, and a 5-in-1 media card reader. Perhaps the only thing missing is an ExpressCard slot, such as you'll find in the <p>Toshiba Satellite A665-S6086</> ($699.99 list, 4 stars). Like most other HP systems, the dv7-4165dx comes with a heap of pre-installed bloatware. This includes 25 HP-branded utilities (and this even isn't counting all the casual games that HP also installed). Hidden within all this muck, however, are a few gems, such as Corel PaintShop Pro X3, Corel VideoStudio Pro X3, and HP's own MediaSmart suite for media playback. The dv7-4165dx comes with an industry-standard, one-year parts-and-labor warranty, and HP offers 24/7 toll-free support. Performance Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processors, such as the 2.4GHz Core i5-450M-based dv7-4083cl, power the majority of the current crop of HP Pavilion dv7 laptops. The dv7-4165dx is an exception, as it instead uses a 2.2GHz AMD Phenom II N850 processor. This is unfortunate, as the mobile Intel processors put out much better overall performance than their AMD compatriots. For instance, the dv7-4165dx's PCMark Vantage score of 4,411 falls far behind that of the dv7-4083cl's score of 5,677 or even the 2.27GHz Core i3-350M-based <p>Acer Aspire TimelineX AS5820T-5951</>'s ($723 street, 4 stars) score of 5,233. The back-of-the-pack performance carries over as well to the dv7-4165dx's Handbrake (3:25) and Photoshop CS5 (8:27) performance tests too. One shining beacon here, however, is the dv7-4165dx's CineBench R11.5 score of 1.86, which actually pulls ahead of some of the Core i3-based laptops such as the AS5820T-5951 (1.81) and A665-S6086 (1.70). The dv7-4165dx likely gets the advantage on this test because its triple-core N850 processor is better utilized by the multithreaded CineBench app than the dual-core Core i3 processors (although the Core i3 also has two virtual cores via Hyper-Threading). This means that the dv7-4165dx can potentially see some performance gains on multithreaded apps that can tap into processors that have multiple cores. Gaming performance is another thing that differentiates the dv7-4165dx from the dv7-4083cl. While the HP dv7-4083cl has a discrete ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 graphics adapter that has modest 3D gaming capabilities, the dv7-4165dx has just a pokey integrated ATI Radeon HD 4250 graphics engine. The HP dv7-4083cl's 3DMark06 score was 4,675, while the dv7-4165dx could only muster a score of 2,135; therefore the dv7-4165dx will have to stick to casual games or much older 3D titles that don't need a lot of horsepower. Before you write off the dv7-4165dx because of its nearly non-existent 3D gaming capabilities, note that very few desktop replacement laptops that sell for under $1,000 actually come with discrete graphicsthe HP dv7-4083cl is very much a rare exception in this case. Perhaps the dv7-4165dx's greatest performance-related achievement would have to be its 7 hours 8 minutes of battery life on the MobileMark 2007 test. This can be chalked up to its 9-cell, 93WH battery. Even though the HP dv7-4083cl has a 9-cell, 87WH battery, the best it could do was 4:41. This makes the dv7-4165dx's battery life one of the longest we've seen for a desktop replacement; perhaps beaten only by the Acer AS5820T-5951's time of 7:37 (the AS5820T-5951 has only a 6-cell 62WH battery, but its low-power CULV processor helps the laptop consume less power). The <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4165dx</>'s large and bright display, great-sounding speakers, Blu-ray drive, and excellent battery life all combine to make it an amazing entertainment laptop. It also happens to be one of the least-expensive desktop replacements we've seen to come with a Blu-ray drive. But alas, its lackluster performance is what separates the dv7-4165dx from its more expensive sibling, the Editors' Choice <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4083cl</>. If you need an entertainment laptop that also has solid performance, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
