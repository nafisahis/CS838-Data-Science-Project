The <p>HP Pavilion Elite HPE-127c-b</> ($1,299.99 list) straddles the line between multimedia powerhouse and a platform for 3D gaming. It uses Intel's new Core i5 processor to deliver top-notch performance, but relies on a comparatively feeble video card that yields only moderate 3D gaming capabilities. Available at Costco and bundled with an HD-capable 25-inch monitor, the HPE-127 packs 8GB of memory and aspires to home theater greatness, with HDMI ports for true 1080p high definition video and digital audio out, although you'll need to add surround sound speakers and, perhaps, a Blu-ray player. Nonetheless, the HPE-127 is well-equipped and performed quite well on our performance tests, making it a very worthy choice for demanding multimedia users. It's not a fire-breathing gaming rig, but it does offer a good feature set and performance at great value for the money. Design The Pavilion Elite HPE-127 looks just a bit fancier than the models in HP's more prosaic "everyday computing" line. The handsome matte black mid-tower includes the HP's standard glossy façade, with the memory card readers and bays tucked behind doors and chrome trim tracing its rounded corners. As usual, HP places the 15-in-one memory card reader at the top of the tower, and adds two USB slots. Placing the USB connectors at the top of tower is a sensible decision because that makes it easier to use short-corded USB devices when the tower is placed on the floor. Adjacent to the card reader are an indicator for the PC's built-in Wi-Fi radio and a light that blinks when its hard drive is in use. Just below, the DVD drive is housed behind a flip-down door; buttons at the right of the optical drives let you easily open and close the drawer. The second optical bay is empty. Beneath the optical drive bays is a door that reveals one USB slot and mic and headphones jack. Some HP Elites include a FireWire port here for connecting to digital camcorders and, given the multimedia emphasis HP places on this line, we would like to have seen FireWire on this machine as well. Excellent Bundled Monitor If forced to single out one component to praise, we would choose the bundled 25-inch monitor. The HP 2509m display, which sells for $349.99 on HP's Website, delivers a widescreen view at a native resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 and a speedy 3-millisecond refresh rate, making it great for screening HD video. It includes an HDMI port for optimal digital video (as well as DVI and VGA ports). Even if you're all work and no play, you'll be pleased with the LCD's size because it enables you to view multiple documents and use several applications at once. The monitor has built-in 2-watt stereo speakers that pump out satisfying sound at an acceptable volume. If you listen to a lot of music, play games, or watch video, you'll want to add a set of speakers (the HPE-127 can accommodate high definition audio with up to 7.1 surround sound). The HPE-127 bundle also includes a USB keyboard with a matching design and a USB mouse. Both work fine, although the plastic feels a bit flimsy. The keyboard has a dedicated numeric pad and hardware buttons for mute and volume up and volume down. Features While many of the models that HP sells at Costco are powered by older processors, the HPE-127 has something new under the hood: Intel's 2.66GHz Core i5-750 CPU. This chip occupies the middle ground that separates Intel's entry-level CPUs and its high-end Core i7 models. HP also includes an ample 8GB of memory and an entry-level Nvidia GeForce GT220 (1GB) graphics card that supports Microsoft DirectX 10.1. Rounding out the package are a 1TB hard drive and a DVD±RW drive with LightScribe. HP integrates an 802.11 b/g/n wireless networking card in the HPE-127, enabling you to wirelessly share an Internet connection and link to network-attached storage (NAS) devices for file sharing and backup. The Wi-Fi radio worked like a charm, connecting to our Lab's wireless network with a full five bars and ample speedwithout an external antenna. Dial-up users, take note: The HPE-127 doesn't ship with a modem. The HPE-127 has a useful array of ports on the back. HP gives you six USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire connector. Multimedia fans will appreciate the HDMI/DVI/VGA connectors provided by the graphics card, as well as the optical audio out and other audio ports for surround-sound speakers. You won't need tools to take a look inside the case: Simply turn a single screw and slide off the side panel. HP provides room for adding a second hard drive, another optical drive, and an additional 3.5-inch device. All four DIMM slots are populated, although that shouldn't be a problem since 8GB of memory is more than adequate for most users. The graphics card occupies the single PCI Express x16 slot (no chance of upgrading to a dual-card set up); two PCI Express x1 slots are available for expansion. There is nothing outstanding in the included software, although HP does include several useful titles like Microsoft Works 9.0, HP MediaSmart Software Suite for working with photos, videos, and music, and CyberLink's DVD Suite for burning CDs and DVDs. Of course, you'll find the usual assortment of bloatware and trial-ware, including a 60-day trial for Norton Internet Security and a 60-day trial (uninstalled) for Microsoft Office, as well as pointers to eBay, Snapfish, Hulu, HP games, and more. HP offers a two-year limited warranty on the PC hardware, which is nice, but includes only a one-year warranty for the monitor. The system also comes with Costco's Concierge Services, a free service to Costco members who purchase electronics at the store. The service gives you access to technicians to walk you system setup, product use, and for troubleshooting. The store accepts returns within 90 days. Performance The Elite HPE-127 uses its Core i5-750 processor to great effect, turning in some outstanding scores in our benchmark tests. The HPE-127's PCMark Vantage showing of 8,177 easily topped similarly priced systems like the <p>HP Pavilion Elite e9160f</> whose Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 processor managed only a score of 5,061. The <p>HP Pavilion Elite e9240f</>, with a 3.0-GHz AMD Phenom x4 945 processor and a 1GB ATI Radeon HD 4650 graphics card, achieved a slightly better 5,506. The HPE-127 even beat the <p>Dell Studio XPS 435</>, which is powered by an Intel Core i7-920 processor and managed a PCMark Vantage score of 6,138. The Elite HPE-127 also fared quite well on 3D graphics testing. It scored 14,528 on 3DMark Vantage (1,024 by 768), beating the HP e9240 (10,349), but it lagged far behind the <p>Dell Studio XPS 435</> (26,532). Most 3D games will be playable on the Elite HPE-127 but with rates like 34 frames per second (fps) in Crysis and 45 fps in World in Conflict, it's not a hardcore gaming rig. The HPE-127 couldn't touch the performance of the <p>Dell Studio XPS 435</> (60 fps on Crysis and 78 fps on World in Conflict, thanks to its ATI Radeon HD 4870 graphics card), but outperformed models like the HP Elite e9160f and HP Elite e9240f. The Elite HPE-127 achieved a leading score of 31 seconds on our Windows Media Encoder tests, and a very fast 14,253 on CineBench R!0. It finished our Photoshop tests in 1 minute 18 seconds, just behind the <p>Dell Studio XPS</> (1:12). The HPE-127 combines enthusiast-level performance with a top-notch 25-inch monitor that can deftly handle 1080p high-definition video. At a price of $1,299.99, this PC-monitor bundle is a great choice for multitasking and working with digital media, and it's a decent (though not stellar) system for 3D gaming.
