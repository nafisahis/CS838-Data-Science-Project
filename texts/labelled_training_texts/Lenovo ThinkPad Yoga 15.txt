The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 15</> ($999 as tested) is a business-oriented laptop with a convertible-hybrid design. The 15-inch system is sized just right as a desktop-replacement, but is uncomfortably wed with the hybrid design of a smaller, more portable laptop, making for some quirks. And also making it difficult to compare with other systems. While there are some parallels to be drawn between the ThinkPad Yoga 15 and its smaller siblings, the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 14</> and the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</>, it's not quite in the same category. As such, the closest comparable Editors' Choice is the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch Retina Display (2014)</>, our top pick for both premium and business desktop-replacement laptops. Design This isn't the first Yoga laptop we've seen for the office, but at 15 inches, it's definitely the largest of the group, big enough to qualify as a desktop-replacement instead of the usual ultraportable. The ThinkPad Yoga 15 expands upon the design of the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 14</> with a larger footprint and room for a 10-key numeric pad with the keyboard. Measuring 0.8 by 15.1 by 10.1 inches (HWD), the laptop is roughly the same size as the non-convertible <p>Asus ZenBook Pro UX501J-DS71T</> and at 5.1 pounds, it is a little heavier than the latter. As business desktop-replacements go, it's larger than the <p>Dell Precision M3800 (2015)</> and the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch. What really sets the Yoga 15 apart from other desktop-replacements is the fact that it's a convertible device with a multimode hinge, letting you open it up like a laptop, and then open it up further to bend around into different modes: Stand, Tent, and Tablet. While this is an extremely useful combination of functions on the 12-inch ThinkPad Yoga, and even on the larger 14-inch model, a 15-inch system may not be the best way to showcase the Yoga concept. In Tablet mode, the ThinkPad Yoga 15 is huge. It's nice for use at a desk or table, and other modes may be useful at times, but if you're going to hold this system in one hand as a tablet and write notes with your other hand, your arms will get tired pretty fast. The Yoga 15 features a 15.6-inch full HD (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) screen. That's the same resolution as the <p>Toshiba Tecra Z50-A1503</>, but most 15-inch systems offer much higher—the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (2014) boasts a 2,800-by-1,800 resolution, while the <p>Dell Precision M3800</> steps up further to Ultra-High-Definition or UHD (3,840 by 2,160)—but those laptops also come with significantly higher prices. As it stands, the full HD resolution of the Yoga 15 is fine for reading text and working with numbers, but maybe not as well suited to sharp graphics reproduction as the Apple and Dell laptops. The Yoga 15 also features touch support, which the others do not. The keyboard features Lenovo's Lift n' Lock design, which pairs a very good chiclet-style keyboard with a frame that raises up to lie flush with the tops of the keys when folded into Tablet mode. The result is a comfortable keyboard and peace of mind that it won't get damaged by setting the keyboard keys-side-down on a surface that could damage it. The system also has dual pointing devices, with both a touchpad and the red TrackPoint that so many Lenovo users will recognize. Features Because it's designed to fold in and out of Tablet mode, the Yoga 15 has its buttons along the sides instead of on the keyboard deck. On the right, you'll find the buttons for Power, Volume Up/Down, and screen lock. Also on the right are two USB ports, (one USB 2.0, one USB 3.0), and a full-size HDMI-out port. On the left are a Power connector (which also acts as a OneLink docking port), one USB 3.0 port, and an SD-card reader. Internally, the Yoga 15 has dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, and WiDi 5.0. The 180GB solid-state drive (SSD) comes with Opal certification for full-disk encryption. The latter is a huge feature for businesses, but the storage capacity itself is quite small in comparison with other systems, like the 512GB SSD in the Asus UX501J-DS71T and the 256GB SSDs found in the <p>Toshiba Tecra Z50-A1503</> and the Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch (2014). Preinstalled on the drive are a few apps and programs, like McAfee LiveSafe security and Microsoft Office 365 (both 30-day trials), along with Lenovo's own SHAREit cloud sharing app. Lenovo covers the Yoga 15 with a one-year warranty. Performance Our review unit came equipped with a 2.2GHz Intel Core i5-5200U processor and 8GB of RAM. Given the CPU selection, you might not expect the system to be competitive with high-end desktop replacements and workstations sporting high-end, quad-core chips, but it does quite well in most respects. In PCMark 8 Work Conventional, for example, the ThinkPad Yoga 15 scored 2,508 points, which isn't far behind the Asus UX501J-DS71T (2,775 points) or the <p>Dell Precision M3800</> (2,664 points), even though both boast Intel Core i7 processors, albeit fourth-generation versions. It also puts the Yoga 15 ahead of the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 14</> (2,410 points). In Photoshop CS6, we saw performance lag a bit, with the ThinkPad Yoga 15 completing the test in 4 minutes 58 seconds. Most competitors finished the test in the 3:00 to 3:30 range, like the Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch (2014) (3:25), the Asus UX501J-DS71T (3:18), and the <p>Dell Precision M3800</> (3:30). It did, however, beat out the ThinkPad Yoga 14 (5:51) by a significant margin. The end result is a laptop that may not stack up well against expensive workstations and premium systems, but still has the chops to carry most office workers through their daily work in spreadsheets, databases, or large Word documents without a hiccup. Graphics performance falls into a similar range. With a discrete Nvidia GeForce 840M card, the ThinkPad Yoga 15 is equipped to tackle most graphics-heavy tasks, though it won't offer 3D gaming capability or workstation-level rendering. It scored 5,786 points in 3DMark Cloud Gate and 726 points in Fire Strike Extreme. While those scores are quite low when compared with the Asus UX501J-DS71T (13,978 points in Cloud Gate; 1,766 points in Fire Strike Extreme) and the <p>Dell Precision M3800</> (7,791 points in Cloud Gate; 618 points in Fire Strike Extreme), it's worth noting that those systems are outfitted with more potent graphics hardware—a gaming-grade GPU and workstation-class Quadro graphics, respectively. The ThinkPad Yoga 15 isn't the right tool for those who need to render architectural models or map geological data, but for most everything else—graphic design, some video editing—it's more than competent. Finally, on battery life, the ThinkPad Yoga 15 falls right in the middle of the pack, lasting 5 hours 48 minutes in our rundown test. It outlasted both the <p>Dell Precision M3800</> (4:53) and the Asus UX501J-DS71T (4:56), but it falls behind the Toshiba Z50-A1503 (7:00) and the long-lasting Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch Retina Display (8:55). ConclusionThe <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 15</> may be difficult to categorize, with its combination of desktop-replacement design and convertible functionality, but the end result is a competent business laptop. Unfortunately, the convertible design feels like something of a waste in this 15-inch, 5.1-pound system, as it's far too large for tablet use, though you may get some use out of Tent and Stand modes. In the end, it's best viewed as a solid business system with touch capability. The most comparable Editors' Choice, the Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch Retina Display, bests it in both performance and battery life, while other alternatives, like the workstation <p>Dell Precision M3800 (2015)</> offer more processing muscle.
