The <p>Acer Aspire Predator AG7750-U2222</> ($1,999.99 list) has a love-or-hate design, but whichever way you go, the system delivers one of the best desktop gaming experience. Lots of expandability and up to Triple-SLI upgradability gives the system the long legs that growing hardcore gamers need. If you're a talented, novice hardcore gamer, and want to train for the big leagues, the Predator is the system that can grow with you over the next 5-7 years. Making it our latest Editors' Choice for mid-range gaming desktops. Design The Predator is not a subtle computerÂ—not many gaming towers are. It's ribbed exterior, garish paint job, and over laden tack-ons are entirely the point of this system. You'll be hard pressed to find a high-end gaming system that isn't over the top, as the majority of boutique system builders have similar, loud chassis designs. Systems from larger makers like Alienware's Area 51 ($3,969 direct, ) and Aurora systems are certainly not subdued. The Predator's predominant colors are black and a bronze-tinted orange. The front panel has an elaborately hinged door that swings up and back to reveal the optical drives and door for the front-facing drive bay. Those optical drives have mandible-like doors that open sideways. It's very busy, but the design philosophy is cohesive overall: It wouldn't seem out of place in a sci-fi movie. It's not quite as solid as say the Mainger Shift ($6,399 direct, ), but it's certainly well put together and feels better than a lot of the thin-plastic DIY (Do It Yourself) cases out there. There's space for up to three Nvidia GeForce GTX 470 graphics cards (one is already included), and there's a 750W power supply to support all three. There's also a PCI card slot and PCIe x1 card slot, but those will be covered up if you add two more GTX 470 cards. An internal bracket helps hold the heavy graphics cards. There aren't any free RAM DIMM slots, but with 12GB pre-installed you shouldn't need more for a while. The inside of the chassis is bisected by a plastic shroud that keeps air flowing through the center, so heat from the liquid-cooled processor doesn't mix with the heat from the graphics cards. All in all, the Predator has a well thought-out interior. The system is well connected, with 11 USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, 2 eSATA ports, and 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports give you a wealth of connection options. The two eSATA ports and Ethernet ports are notable, since most systems usually have only one (or none). Two Ethernet ports will let you connect to two disparate networks at the same time. This feature comes in handy if you like to play games connected directly to your cable modem, but you'd rather surf the Web from behind your router. Direct connect to your cable modem is faster, but filtering the Internet through your router is safer. Features The Predator comes with 12GB of memory, which should be enough for any gamer and most high-end multimedia use. It's easy to setup the Predator with tons of hard drive space thanks to its hot-swappable drive bays. There are three free drive bays in the front of the system, with three sleds you can pop in and out easily. They're a bit more secure than the ones on the Gateway FX6800 series gaming desktops like the FX6840-01e ($999.99 list, ). If you keep the included 1.5TB drive and install three 2TB drives, you'll have 7.5TB of space on tap. Anyone that needs that much space is either on Bittorrent 24/7, or a film student. The system comes with a plethora of bloatware, which shouldn't be surprising, given Acer's retail focus. Stuff like McAfee Internet Security Suite has a short 60-day trial subscription, and Acer is still foisting their eSobi news reader on its users. Ads for eBay and Netflix litter the Start menu and desktop. Game systems, ideally, are clean of any additional programs, but Windows 7, drivers for the required hardware, and maybe software for the DVD burner. All the rest are unneeded extras. That way, you won't ever have to worry about other programs interfering with gameplay. Regardless, the system lost at least a half-point for the bloatware. Performance For gaming systems, performance is everything. The Predator proved that by playing Crysis (74 fps) and Lost Planet 2 (109 fps) smoothly at medium/middle settings. However, it falls short on the very high/high settings with a score of 26 fps for Crysis and 42fps for Lost Planet 2. Having that second or third GeForce GTX 470 card would definitely help the Predator's high-end scores. That said, among a group of recently tested gaming rigs with GTX 460 cards like the <p>CyberPower Gamer Dragon</>, <p>iBuypower LAN Warrior II</>, and <p>Polywell MiniBox X5800x-3D</>, the Predator ended up on top for 3D gaming. It also won the 3DMark Vantage test at Entry (50,505) and Extreme (7,215) settings. The Predator is certainly fast enough for multimedia tasks. It was the top scorer at the Handbrake test (2 minutes 1 second) and PhotoShop CS5 test (4:06). Handbrake is our new video transcoding test replacing Windows Media Encoder, and our new CS5 test is much harder than our old CS4 test. The Predator (5.08) finished behind the <p>Cyberpower Gamer Dragon</> (5.84) in the CineBench R11.5 test, since the Cyberpower has an overclocked AMD Phenom II 6-core processor. Compared with other midrange gaming boxes, the <p>Acer Aspire Predator AG7750-U2222</> is a class leader. It's the fastest overall compared with other multi-core systems with a single mid-range enthusiast graphics card. The Polywell MiniBox is similarly priced at $2,099, but the Predator far outclasses the Poly on performance and expandability. The Predator's roomy and easy to upgrade chassis makes it the perfect accomplice if you're the type that likes to upgrade graphics cards and hard drives down the road. The biggest drawback to the system is the boatload of bloatware. You could spend an afternoon uninstalling all of it, or if you're geeky you could install a fresh store-bough copy of Windows 7 on the system. The Predator $2,000 has class leading performance, expandability, and features. For all these reasons, the <p>Acer Aspire Predator AG7750-U2222</> is our new Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops.
