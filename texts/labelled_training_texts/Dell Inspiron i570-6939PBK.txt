For an entry-level desktop to win an Editors' Choice award, it doesn't necessarily need to deliver a knockout blow. At this segment of the PC market, it can simply out-score the competition by delivering a competitive feature set for the money while avoiding any deal breakers along the way. The <p>Dell Inspiron i570-6939PBK</> ($598.99 list), a desktop bundle from Staples that includes and a 20-inch LCD, edges out other entry-level bundles, such as the <p>HP Pavilion a4327c-b</> ($600, ) and the model it replaces, the Dell Inspiron 546 (i546-4356nbk) ($600, ). The Inspiron i570-6939PBK and HP a4327c-b are very similar bundles, both based on the dual-core AMD Athlon II X2 240 CPU, but the Dell is the better deal because it features a larger hard drive and a more current integrated graphics chip. We recommend it as an entry-level desktop bundle with one caveat: if you don't need an LCD, your same $600 can net you a quad-core desktop such as the <p>HP Pavilion p6310f</> ($600, ). A quad-core PC will obviously offer better performance than a dual-core machine, but the Inspiron i570-6939PBK offers more than enough oomph for general home or office use. Design The Inspiron i570-6939PBK uses the same case as the previous Inspiron 546 we reviewed last fall. It's your basic mini-tower chassis that will fit under or on top of your desk. The front is a piano black with flip-down drive covers that present an attractive, simple appearance. The front panel features a multi-format media card reader, two USB ports, and headphone/mic jacks. Around back, you'll find four more USB ports, another set of audio ports, VGA and HDMI, one Ethernet and two modem jacks. It's a standard low-end setup that lacks mainstream PC connections such as an eSATA port and an integrated Wi-Fi antenna. Inside, the PC offers some room for expansion, highlighted by a PCIe x16 slot that will let you add a graphics card. There are also open two PCIe x1 slots and a PCI slot that's occupied by a modem card. You also have a free 5.25-inch drive bay to which you can add another optical drive and a free 3.5-inch drive bay to add another hard drive. All four DIMM slots are occupied, so if you want to expand the system's 4GB of memory, you'll need to replace the 1GB sticks with higher capacity modules. The bundled LCD features a 16:9 screen, framed in a matte black bezel. The back of the display and its base, in a design departure, are a glossy white. No matter, the Inspiron i570-6939PBK and the display will fit in almost any home or office setting. A basic black keyboard and wired, optical mouse are also included. Features The Inspiron i570-6939PBK features a dual-core 2.8GHz AMD Athlon II X2 240 processor, 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM, a 640GB hard drive, and integrated ATI Radeon HD 4200 graphics. Any integrated graphics solution borrows resources from the main system memory and is incapable of playing the vast majority of intensive 3D games, but the ATI Radeon HD 4200 chip is AMD's most advanced integrated chip and offers a small modicum of gaming performance. It's also capable of displaying HD video and handling light 3D rendering, as shown by the benchmark numbers below. It offers better performance than the non-HD capable Intel GMA 3100 graphics in competitors like the <p>HP Pavilion p6234f-b</> ($750, ). The bundled 20-inch monitor, the Dell ST2010 LCD, lists for $150 and costs $130 at Staples. It features a cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1,600 by 900 screen resolution. The display lacks speakers, but a basic set of PC speakers is included in the Inspiron i570-6939PBK bundle. DVDs looked smooth and crisp using a VGA connection (which you can improve by using an HDMI connection; cable not included), and the wide aspect ratio is a benefit when viewing movies or two documents side by side. On the software front, the Inspiron i570-6939PBK comes with Windows 7 Home Premium and little in the way of bloatware. HP and Gateway are both more egregious bloatware offenders. Microsoft Works and a 30-day trial to McAfee Internet Security highlight the software bundle. Performance A modern dual-core PC like the Inspiron i570-6939PBK with an ample 4GB of memory can handle nearly any task in the home or office. It posted better scores on all three of our multimedia benchmark tests than the previous Dell Inspiron 546 model, which used the slightly slower 2.7GHz Athlon II X2 215 processor on AMD's previous-generation ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics. If you run demanding graphics apps with any regularity, or even if you might classify yourself as a heavy multitasker, you may be better served by passing on this bundle and purchasing a quad-core system. The <p>HP Pavilion p6310f</> costs $600 (without an LCD) and not only does it boast a quad-core AMD Athlon II X4 630, but it also includes more RAM (6GB) and a huge 1TB hard drive. Compared with the Inspiron i570-6939PBK, the HP p6310f was 25 percent faster on PCMark Vantage, and 31 and 35 percent faster on our Windows Media Encoder and Photoshop tests, respectively. Most impressively, the HP p6310f nearly doubled the score of the Inspiron i570-6939PBK on Cinebench R10, but then again the CineBench test measures the system's ability to render 3D images in a modeling program (not the kind of thing that a regular web user will care about). Although a quad-core system clearly outperforms a dual-core system like the Dell i570, we still recommend this PC bundle for the simple fact that the vast majority of basic PC users won't take much advantage--if any at all--of quad-core processing. For general home use, we like this convenient Dell bundle for the features and performance if offers for the price, plus its clean, bloatware-free hard drive. It's the perfect package for the buyer is is either replacing their desktop setup (including, say, an ancient CRT monitor) or purchasing the first PC. Among dual-core systems, the Inspiron i570-6939PBK ran as expected. Its benchmark scores showed incremental gains to that of the Inspiron 546. For example, it finished our Photoshop test 20 seconds faster than the Inspiron 546 and sped through the Cinebench R10 script with 14 percent better score. In anecdotal testing, Windows 7 felt fast and responsive, even under various multitasking scenarios. In the end, the <p>Dell Inspiron i570-6939PBK</> earns an Editors' Choice for entry-level desktop, replacing the Compaq CQ5210f ($390, ), because it serves up competitive features for the money inside a convenient bundle that includes an attractive, versatile 20-inch LCD. It makes for easy, one-stop shopping for basic home and office users. Do note that quad-core PC prices have dropped dramatically in the past year, so noticeably better performance isn't far from reach. Don't overlook a quad-core system like the <p>HP Pavilion p6310f</> if you already own a serviceable LCD or find a deal on one.
