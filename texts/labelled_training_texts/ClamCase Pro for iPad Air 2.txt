Inside and out, the ClamCase Pro and <p>Zagg Slim Book for iPad Air 2</> are direct rivals. Both look very similar, and one is even clad in white while the other is adorned in black. Spoiler alert: The ClamCase Pro has the better keyboard (only by a narrow margin), but the Zagg Slim Book offers a little more versatility with its detachable keyboard and case sections. That said, the main differentiator here price, which, unfortunately, is only one of the $169.99 ClamCase Pro's weaknesses. As a result, the Editors' Choice award remains in the Zagg Slim Book's side of the court. Design and FeaturesMeasuring in at 9.72 by 7.36 by 0.70 inches (HWD), the ClamCase Pro is ever so slightly larger than the Slim Book, but you'd only be able to tell by holding both cases side by side. Weighing in at 18.56 ounces (1.16 pounds), it's also slightly heavier than the Slim Book; the extra weight comes from the ClamCase Pro's heavier hinge. The interior of the ClamCase Pro's keyboard section is made of aluminum with a white plastic inlay, where the slightly rounded, square black plastic keys lie. Unfortunately, the keys aren't backlit like they are on the <p>Zagg Slim Book for iPad Air 2</>. The exterior of both the keyboard and case sections are made of a white polycarbonate plastic that doesn't scratch as much as the Slim Book's black plastic exterior. There are four rubber bumpers on each corner of the keyboard section's exterior to prevent the case from slipping around while typing. Unfortunately, the keyboard section feels a little uneven when you use it in a laptop-style configuration on a flat surface, as there's some wobbling where my right palm rests. ClamCase's signature 360-degree hinge is present in the iPad Air 2 model, and it offers great versatility for configuring the case in different viewing modes. For example, you can have the case in the aforementioned laptop arrangement, or you can swivel the keyboard section back, so the keys are facing downwards against a flat surface. The latter offers better angles for watching videos or general iPad usage without holding it. Thankfully, the ClamCase Pro's keyboard disables itself when you swivel it past 180 degrees, so as to prevent unwanted key hits. I love the 360-degree hinge, and it makes the Zagg Slim Book's 135-degree hinge seem relatively inferior. However, the Slim Book lets you detach the keyboard and case sections from its magnetic hinge, which lets you shed the keyboard section's weight should you not need it, as well as configure the iPad/case combo in similar viewing modes as the ClamCase Pro. On the top left edge of the keyboard section is a switch to turn the Bluetooth keyboard on or off. A micro USB port on the same section's top right edge allows for charging with the included cable. ClamCase claims the case's battery lasts up to several months of use on a single charge, depending on how often you use the keyboard. Several months is perfectly sufficient, regardless of how vague the statement is, but Zagg claims its Slim Book can last up to two years on a single charge with regular usage. Either way, battery life shouldn't be a deal breaker for the ClamCase Pro. Pairing the ClamCase Pro with an iPad Air 2 is as easy as it gets and a one-time affair. A simple flick of the power switch to the On position and a press of the dedicated Bluetooth key towards the keyboard's bottom right will enable the case's pairing mode, which is signified by a blinking LED above the Lock/Unlock key at the top right. Once you've done that, you select and pair the case with your iPad in iOS 8's Bluetooth settings like you would any other Bluetooth device. The older <p>ClamCase Pro for iPad Air</>'s opening for the iPad Air's 3.5mm audio port was too narrow to allow anything wider than the stock Apple EarPods' connector to connect. ClamCase has somewhat rectified this issue by including a headphone connector adapter, but the opening is now even narrower than before. It's a solution, but it's not ideal, as you now need to carry around the adapter if you want to use any headphones at all, even Apple's EarPods. If you lose the small adapter, you're pretty much out of luck unless you buy another one. I tried using a headphone adapter from a different product, but it proved to be too wide to fit through the opening. If you use headphones with the ClamCase Pro, you'll either need to keep the adapter in a safe place, or plugged into the iPad all the time. Performance and ConclusionBar none, the ClamCase Pro has the best keyboard on any case we've tested so far. The keys are slightly smaller than I'd like, but they're well spaced in their familiar places, and they offer premium-feeling, padded-yet-springy feedback. The ClamCase Pro's keys also have deeper, more satisfying travel than the Slim Book's keys. The top row consists of iPad-specific keys, including Home, Search, Cut, Copy, Paste, Microphone, Lock/Unlock, and Keyboard On/Off buttons, as well as media controls like Volume. As one reviewing keyboards should, I used the ClamCase Pro to type this very review with an iPad Air 2. Not once did I encounter any key bouncing (or key repetition), which can be an issue with Bluetooth keyboards. I only experienced it once with the Slim Book. Another issue I had with the Slim Book was that the Delete key would sometimes stall when trying to erase entire sentences, forcing me at times to hit the key repeatedly for each letter. This was not the case with the ClamCase Pro, as the Delete key worked flawlessly and could delete this whole review in one go if needed. The keyboard proved to be even more comfortable to type on than the full-size Lenovo desktop keyboard I'm currently using with my work computer, which is saying a lot. The <p>ClamCase Pro for iPad Air 2</> is an excellent keyboard case. Were it not for its $169.99 price tag, it could have been an Editors' Choice. That's $30 shy of the $200 mark, which is enormously expensive for a keyboard case. As such, I'm sad to say that I don't feel comfortable giving it our Editors' Choice accolade, which is a shame as the keyboard is fantastic. If you can't quite stomach the price tag, the Editors' Choice <p>Zagg Slim Book for iPad Air 2</> offers a similarly excellent typing experience, backlit keys, and superior versatility thanks to its detachable sections, all for $40 less than the ClamCase Pro. But if money is no object, and you don't mind carrying the keyboard section's weight around even when you don't need it, the ClamCase Pro is for you.
