The Apple iMac comes in four base models: a $1,119 20-inchsystem plus three 24-inch models culminating in the $2,199 (direct) top-of-the-line 24-inch iMac (Nvidia GeForce GT 130) reviewed here. I've already given the midpriced ($1,499) 24-inch iMac (Nvidia GeForce 9400M) an Editors' Choice, both for being an object of lust and for offering good bang for the buck in the all-in-one desktop space. Unfortunately, the high-end iMac won't be joining it, but it's still a terrific system that will serve graphic artists and other content creators well. The $2,199 iMac (GT 130) has the same exact exterior and beautiful 24-inch widescreen monitor as its $1,499 brother, so if you're buying the iMac strictly for its looks, get the cheaper one. That said, the $2,199 model comes with a 3.06-GHz Core 2 Duo E8435 processor (the same as the previous 3.06GHz Penryn model, but faster than the 2.66-GHz CPU found in the new, cheaper iMac 24-inch), a larger 1TB hard drive (640GB for the $1,499 model), and most important, the Nvidia GeForce GT 130 discrete graphics card (up from the integrated GeForce 9400M in the cheaper model). Likewise, the new iMac improves upon the last 3.06-GHz iMac, which had 2GB of DDR2 memory, a 500GB hard drive, and GeForce 8800GS graphics. The new 1TB drive is a boon to digital media collectors. Sure, you could hook up an external drive to boost storage, but to do so would spoil the clean lines of the iMac. iMacs aren't known for their expandability, so the drive that ships with the system is likely to be it for the life of the system. The extra 2GB of memory helps content creators in both the Mac OS and in Windows, as well as helping overall performance. The new GeForce GT 130 graphics is a significant improvement over the GeForce 8800 GS graphics in the previous 24-inch iMac. Both have midlevel graphics cards, but the GT 130 gives the iMac a bunch of extra 3D oomph. For even more 3D performance, you can option in the ATI Radeon HD 4850, but CTO (configure to order) options like graphics and extra memory (up to 8GB) will increase your waiting time for delivery (four to six weeks extra at press time), not to mention the final price tag. The 24-inch iMac (GT 130) has many of the same positives and negatives that the iMac (Nvidia GeForce 9400M) has: Positives include no crapware, the new iLife '09 suite, the large screen, and recyclability. Negatives include the lack of digital media card readers, a slippery and temperamental Apple Mighty Mouse, only 90 days of phone tech support, a shorter standard keyboard, a quirky 64-bit Vista installation, and lack of Blu-ray and eSATA. (On the Windows setup, Boot Camp works only with 32-bit Windows Vista or XP, but you can install 64-bit Vista manually using the 64-bit drivers on the iMac's installer CD. Once Vista is installed, you can switch between it and the Mac OS by holding down the Option key during start-up.) The iMac (GT 130) finished the Photoshop CS4 test in a quick 1 minute 35 seconds in Windows Vista, and 1:57 in Mac OS X. Both are very good scores and are even competitive with quad-core-powered systems like the Cybernet iOne GX-31 (1:57) and the <p>HP Pavilion Elite m9550f</> (1:33). When you compare the Photoshop score with that of the older 3.06-GHz iMac (2:16), you really see the improvement that the extra 2GB of memory gives you. The memory is also faster: 1,066-MHz DDR3 SDRAM, up from 800-MHz DD2 in the previous version. The iMac (GT 130) finished the Windows Media Encoder (WME) test in 56 seconds. I consider any WME time of less than 1 minute a very good score. The quad-core iOne and Pavilion Elite outpace the iMac a smidge at 44 and 43 seconds, respectively. PCMark Vantage scores (which measure the system's ability to handle day-to-day tasks) improved from 4,448 in the old iMac to 4,917 in the new. The new iMac is good enough, at least for casual players, to play both Crysis (48 fps) and World in Conflict (50 fps) at the lower 1,280-by-1,024 resolution. Hard-core gamers will want a Crysis score of 60 fps or more, as they'll start complaining that they're noticing missed frames in the 45-to-60-fps range. World in Conflict frame rates will seem steady for most gamers, since RTS (real-time strategy) games are playable at a frame rate as low as 30 fps. The iMac's 3D scores far outpaced the iOne, which can't run DX10 3D games at all, and the m9550f posted scores similar to the iMac's. The "old" iMac had a playable WiC score (45 fps), but Crysis was mostly too jerky to play at 36 fps (you could play it, but it won't be as much fun). Therefore, the new graphics are worth it for 3D gaming, and the additional faster memory helps for everything else. The iMac (GT 130) earns our PCMag.com GreenTech Approved rating, thanks to a combination of green certifications, company policies, and energy usage. Like the other new iMacs and Mac minis, the iMac (GT 130) has EPEAT Gold certification, meets Energy Star 5.0 criteria, and the system itself is made of easily recyclable materials. Apple accepts your old computer and monitor for recycling if you buy a new Mac, and systems collected in North America are recycled locally. Last but not least, the iMac (GT 130) uses only a few Watts more power than its brother, the iMac (Nvidia GeForce 9400M). The iMac (GT 130) uses 98W of power while idling (vs. 95W for the iMac (9400M)), and 120W while under load (vs. 118W for the iMac (9400M)). Considering the extra graphics power in the iMac (GT 130), it's a decent tradeoff. This also makes the iMac (GT 130) more energy efficient than the <p>Sony VAIO VGC-LV190Y</> which idles at 132W and uses 160W under load. Like the $1,499, 24-inch iMac (Nvidia GeForce 9400M), the $2,199 iMac (Nvidia GeForce GT 130) gives the casual user a whole lot more screen real estate and day-to-day performance than the 19-inch <p>Cybernet iOne-GX31</> touch-screen all-in-one. The iOne is $2,358 and more business-oriented, so unless you really need the touch screen, the iMac is a better home PC. The $2,900 Sony VGC-LV190Y is our current high-end all-in-one Editors' Choice, and it still deserves that honor for the included HDMI-in, TV tuner, and Blu-ray drive. It is, however, burdened by crapwarenot a lot, but some. The LV190Y is the ultimate all-in-one entertainment PC, though the iMac may be better suited to the home or business user who doesn't need all those media features but really needs a fast Mac. Stepping up means going to the Mac Pro, and that behemotha standard desktop rather than an all-in-oneis really meant for those deified content creators with titles like Media Guru or Senior Art Director. The iMac (Nvidia GeForce GT 130) is a high-end system for people who spend their whole workday in Photoshop (or Final Cut Express, or Logic Express, for video and music editing, respectively), or any of the other prosumer and professional content creation applications for both Windows and Macs. So, is springing for the <p>Apple iMac (Nvidia GeForce GT 130)</> worth it? That depends. If you're a home user who just wants a dock for your iPhone and a great overall all-in-one desktop, get the $1,499 iMac with integrated GeForce 9400M graphics (our midpriced all-in-one Editors' Choice). If you absolutely need a home entertainment center, go with our high-end all-in-one Editors' Choice, the <p>Sony VAIO VGC-LV190Y</>. However, if you're the type who needs the power to finish Photoshop or video projects but you don't feel as if you need or can afford a Mac Pro, get this pricier 24-inch iMac.
