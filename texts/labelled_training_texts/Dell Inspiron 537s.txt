The latest addition to Dell's Inspiron line is also its smallest. The new 537s ($658 direct, $858 with 20-inch widescreen monitor) is one compact desktop. It's also one of the less expensive models out there to feature a discrete graphics card with built-in HDMI-out, which is useful for connecting to HDTVs or large-screen monitors with HDMI ports. Like most Dell PCs, you can customize the heck out of it. To keep the 537s under $700 for the base unit, the folks at Dell made some tradeoffs, some good and some that made me scratch my head. The Inspiron 537s as configured here will be a decent primary (or secondary) system in your home, but there are better choices in the budget space. Design The "s" in 537s stands for Small Form Factor. This means that the PC is 42 percent smaller than the full tower version of the Inspiron 537. That doesn't mean, however, that it's hobbled by any means. The 537s still has the option of eight colored faceplates, chosen when you order the system (including the "Plum Purple" of our review unit.) It can be equipped with a Core 2 Quad processor (ours came with a Pentium Dual Core) and a 512MB ATI Radeon HD 4350 graphics card (like our test system). The system is about 15 inches by 4 inches by 17 inches (HWD), so it will fit on most work surfaces, even a space-constrained dorm desk. That said, something must suffer for the smaller case size: Namely graphics cards, which need to be half-height to fit, limiting your options there. Also, the 537s only comes with a 250W compact power supply unit; you'll need a higher capacity power supply for aftermarket upgrades like a faster graphics card. Features Of course internal expansion is limited, as well. There are two free PCI slots and one free PCIE x1 slot, but there isn't any space for additional optical drives, hard drives, or RAM. The 537s is limited to 4GB of memory: not terrible, but not great either. The system has six USB 2.0 ports (a good number), but could use a FireWire or eSATA port for external hard drive expansion if you fill up the internal 500GB hard drive. One plus with the Radeon graphics card is that it boasts a built-in HDMI port, so you can hook it straight to an HDMI-equipped monitor or HDTV. Web videos look fine played back on the 537s, even "HD" videos on YouTube and 1080p QuickTime clips. Dell sent us a S2009W 20-inch widsescreen monitor ($200 direct) to go along with the 537s and, while it doesn't have an HDMI port, videos look fine played through the DVI port. The S2009W has a resolution of 1,600-by-900, so true 1080p (1,920-by-1,080) videos are scaled down a bit. Dell has done a great job keeping bloatware off their systems. You know, those trialware and extra software you didn't ask for, yet get stuck with when you buy a PC from many big box stores (and some system builders)? The only "bloaty" stuff on the 537s is a shortcut on the desktop to eBay, and you can drop that in the recycle bin easily. Other systems (like the HP Pavilion 6127c-b) come with a glut of bloatware like Internet security programs that expire too soon and "special offers" for Microsoft Office trialware, and dial-up Internet services. The 537s in contrast comes configured simply with Microsoft Works and a 15-month subscription to McAfee SecurityCenter (Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, firewall, etc.). On the bloatware front, Dell is winning. Performance The 537s is particularly well suited to the family room and the dorm room, and not just because it takes up little space on a desk or table. Its dual-core Pentium processor and 3GB of RAM make the system a decent photo editor and video transcoder, though if you are the impatient type, you'll want to uncheck the ATI Radeon HD 4350 card while you're configuring your system, and check the Intel Core 2 Quad option instead. If you'd rather view razor sharp HD Blu-ray movies, keep the Radeon card and add the $120 optional Blu-ray reader/DVD burner combo drive. I'd keep the Pentium to save a little money if you're building a Blu-ray player/PC combo. The 537s is a capable multimedia box: It garnered a time of 1:13 on our Windows Media Encoder test and 1:59 at PhotoShop CS4. Quad-core systems like the Inspiron 545 and <p>Lenovo IdeaCentre K220</> are noticeably faster at the same tasks. However, the 537s does have a better graphics card than the K220 and is miles better at 3D graphics than the Inspiron 545. The 537s' ATI Radeon HD 4350 card isn't really suited for hard-core 3D gaming, but it did run our gaming benchmarks at twice the speed of the K220. (The 545 couldn't run them at all.) Think of the Radeon card as a plus for when HD video becomes the standard online, since it has HD video acceleration as its raison d'Ãªtre. Compared to our past Editors' Choice in the value category, the Lenovo K220, the Dell 537s is more compact, and shares the Lenovo's limited bloatware. The K220 does have a bit more internal expansion space and that quad-core processor, however. Likewise, the similarly priced <p>HP Pavilion p6127c-b </>and p6140f have quad-core power, but both lose points for bloatware. The Mac mini is even more compact than the 537s, but Apple also had to make some concessions: A slower hard drive and dual-core processor limit the mini's performance, and it has even less internal expansion space than the 537s. Finally, the current value PC Editors' Choice, the <p>Dell Inspiron 545</> holds on to its title, thanks to surprising performance at the multimedia benchmarks and its tower's expandability. In the package I tested, the 545 also came with a larger and more capable 23-inch widescreen monitor, well worth the $41 price premium over the 537s with 20-inch monitor. The Inspiron 537s has decent bones, but Dell needs to work on shaping its muscle. In its reviewed configuration, the compromises are a little imbalanced toward the 3D graphics card. I'd recommend eschewing the discrete card and shifting resources to quad-core processing (to boost 2D photo/video multimedia creation performance), or adding a Blu-ray player to the graphics card for a more satisfying video playing experience for home users. As it is, the 537s only rates as OK.
