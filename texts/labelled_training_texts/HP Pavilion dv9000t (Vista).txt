A Media Center laptop is a PC with multiple personalities. It's a desktop replacement, a portable, and, ultimately, it's a living-room entertainment system. Three months ago, I reviewed the <p>HP Pavilion dv9000t</> ($2,569 direct), but hesitated to give it an Editors' Choice, thinking that a better Media Center laptop was in the works. It never happened. One alternative I had my eye on, the <p>Toshiba Qosmio G35-AV660</>, had a long list of A/V features that could make anyone salivate, but it turned out to lack many of HP's finishing touches, especially when it came to high definition. Now, with the latest iteration of the <p>HP Pavilion dv9000t</> (now with Vista) clearly having the best HD playback software developed for the included HD DVD-ROM drive, not to mention a neat little remote that fits in the ExpressCard slot, I'm ready to hand it the Editors' Choice. If that doesn't convince you, maybe the fact that all the cool features in the newest dv9000t are neatly tied together by Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate will. There's a lot to be said about HP's design: The artistic imprints and the piano-black finish make it flashier than the Qosmio AV660. Its dimensions are thin, too: 15.5 by 11.1 by 1.1 inches (HWD). At 8.8 pounds, the dv9000t is still heavy, but considerably lighter than the boxy AV660. The HP has two options for screen resolution available: 1,440-by-900 and 1,680-by-1050. My configuration came with the latter, which looks great playing back high-definition content from either the hard drive or the HD DVD-ROM drive. The Qosmio AV660 has a true 1080p resolution (1,920-by-1,200), but you'll be hard pressed to find any differences between the two on the 17-inch screen. High-definition players are the new wave for Media Centers, and since both the HP and Toshiba have built-in HD DVD-ROM drives, it's only natural to dissect the software. Toshiba has made drastic improvements to its playback software (Toshiba HD DVD Player), but HP's QuickPlay 2.3 is more refined and more integrated. For example, running an initial disc read is faster on the dv9000t than on the AV660. In Windows XP, you can also play HD DVDs (along with regular DVDs and audio CDs) without booting into the OS. HP assured me that they'll have figured out how to handle high-def discs without booting Vista soon. The company enlisted the help of Cyberlink, creators of the PowerDVD suite, to bring uninterrupted HD playback to the dv9000t (Vista), and it shows. I also have to give kudos to Nvidia for its part in providing the hardware component (HD acceleration and Post Processing) for smooth HD playback. Subjectively, playback quality appears to be smoother, and scene transitions look more natural. I also like the fact that both the AV660 and the dv9000t have built-in infrared sensors for the remote. Nothing annoys me more than attaching a clunky USB receiver, as you still have to do with the <p>Dell Inspiron E1705 (Vista)</>. The innovatively designed remote for the HP is small enough to fit into the laptop's ExpressCard slot, whereas the Qosmio AV660 uses a bulky, unattractive Media Center remote. Both units have physical playback controls above the keyboard; the dv9000t's are touch-sensitive and backlit for low-light environments. Both units also have HDMI-out ports, which is important if you want to hook your laptop up to a larger display (say, your living-room TV), as HDMI streams both video and audio. In contrast, the <p>Dell XPS M1710 (Blu-ray)</> uses a DVI-out port for HD output, but it requires a separate cable for audio. The Qosmio AV660 has an integrated TV tunerÂ—the one thing that it has over the dv9000t (Vista). This is a shortcoming that HP has to fix in the long run. In the meantime, a free upgrade to an HP ExpressCard TV Tuner is available for the system. For video chatting and webcasts, the dv9000t comes with a built-in webcam. It's hard to summarize the Windows Vista Ultimate experience in one paragraph, so I'll stick with discussing its functionality with the dv9000t (Vista). Obviously, the interface is gorgeous. The little remote, the webcam, the touch-sensitive keys, and the rest of the features work seamlessly with Vista Ultimate. A big screen really shows off Vista's 3D interface, and the Media Center component is very intuitive. The QuickPlay software is built into to the menu, so you can access your HD DVDs directly from Media Center's interface. 3D games such as Prey, Company of Heroes, and Lego's Star Wars II ran fine at low resolutions (1,024-by-768). At higher resolutions, though, Prey showed significant lag and Prey benchmark tests failed. Once Vista settles in, I anticipate that Prey's manufacturer, ID Software, will release a patch, and nVidia will update its video drivers. The dv9000t's performance in Win XP is in line with that of the Qosmio AV660. Both are powered by a 2-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 and 2GB of RAM, which is plenty to power Vista's complex interface. Adobe Photoshop CS2 performance differences were minimal when I ran the dv9000t in both Windows XP and Vista. Vista felt a bit slower than Win XP for gaming, but again, video drivers will eventually close the performance gap. The dv9000t's graphics card, however, did outperform the ATI chipset found in the <p>Dell Inspiron E1705 (Vista)</>. Since I couldn't quantify battery life using an industry benchmark test (MobileMark 2007 will not be released until March), I created an anecdotal test by running down a DVD. The battery lasted 1 hour 52 minutes on this test when running Vista, which isn't much. You'll get close to 3 hours for typical tasks such as working in Microsoft Office and surfing the Web, according to HP. The Dell E1705, on the other hand, has a bigger 80-Wh battery and managed to churn out 2:30 running down the same DVD. There are numerous media centers with high-definition drives in the market, but none can equal the impressive playback quality and combination of features found in the <p>HP Pavilion dv9000t (Vista)</>. If you're looking for a portable alternative to that old desktop system you're using, this is the desktop replacement of choice. See the comparison table of Vista notebooks.
