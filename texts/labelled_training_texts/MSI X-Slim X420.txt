Consumer Ultra Low Voltage (CULV) laptops have hit a lull lately, as Intel took its time launching the latest Ultra Low Voltage Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors. Still, that's not stopping companies like MSI from launching them. The <p>MSI X-Slim X420</> ($800 street) purged the internal optical drive in favor of a super thin 14-inch frame. Though the Core 2 Duo U7300 processor is based on last year's technology, its two energy-efficient cores took the 63WH battery for a 7+ hour ride. But even with the two graphics chipsetsone integrated (Intel) and one discrete (ATI) and 4GB of DDR3 memory, it was no match for the Editors' Choice <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> ($899 street, ). Design For such a thin laptop, the X420 takes a very conservative approach with design. Its brown, shiny plastics can easily be overlooked, as brighter colors attract more attention on store shelves. Case in point: The <p>Apple MacBook (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz)</> ($999 direct, ) effectively uses bright whites to draw in the crowds. It lacks the luxurious finish of metals, such as the aluminum exteriors found in the <p>Asus UL80Vt-A1</> ($823 street, ) and <p>Asus U30JC-A1</>. Dull plastics aside, the X420 is undeniably thin and light, measuring 13.8 by 9 by 0.8 inches (HWD) and weighing 4.4 pounds. Comparable laptops like the Asus UL80Vt-1A (4.7 lbs) and U30Jc-1A (4.7 lbs) are slightly thicker and heavier, because they integrate optical drives; the X420 omits one. At 14 inches, the X420's widescreen strikes a good balance between portability and screen real estate. Though at these prices, expect average brightness levels and an average 1,366 by 768 resolution. The Apple MacBook, Asus UL80Vt-1A, and <p>HP Pavilion dm4</> ($905 direct, ) all have standard WXGA resolutions as well. Like most companies, MSI has found a winning feature in the chiclet keyboard. All the letter keys are shaped like perfect squares, each having an area all to itself. Every key is almost identical in size to that of the MacBook and Asus UL80Vt-1A. The textured touchpad has a nice grainy feel and the cursor dragged fluidly, in concert with my index finger. Features The X420 is missing one feature that most of its peers have: An internal DVD burner. Granted, an optical drive is no longer a critical feature, as many can simply download content from the web. For those that need one, the Asus UL80Vt-1A, <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</>, and MacBook all come with dual-layer DVD burners. Otherwise, the X420 comes with all your basic features, including 3 USB ports, VGA-out, Ethernet port, and multimedia card reader. It has an HDMI port as well, which will allow you to drive video or slideshow content to your living room flat panel. One of the USB ports also doubles as an eSATA, so in the unlikely case that the included 500GB drive isn't cavernous enough, you can plug in an external hard drive and take advantage of eSATA's blazing speeds. Performance A CULV processor is the brain behind the X420, running on two cores, but at diminished speeds and lower voltages than its standard-voltage counterparts. As for actual specs, the system runs a 1.3GHz Intel Core 2 Duo SU7300 CPU and 4GB of DDR3 memory, which are the same parts found in the Asus UL80Vt-1A. The Core 2 Duos, however, are based on an older technology, displaced by the more recent Intel Core processors. For instance, the Intel Core i3-350M processor found in the <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> and the 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-520M found in the HP dm4 are exceedingly faster, as evidenced by performance tests. The X420 encoded a video in 1 minute 40 seconds, whereas the U30Jc-1A (54 seconds) and dm4 (49 seconds) finished in under a minute. Its Cinebench R10 (2,714) and PCMark Vantage (2,774) scores fell miserably behind its Core i3 and i5 counterparts. It even trailed the Asus UL80Vt-1A, which uses the same basic partsa 32-bit operating system Windows 7 Home Premium is one culprit, as it doesn't address the full 4GB of system memory. As with the <p>Asus UL80Vt-A1</>, <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</>, and <p>Lenovo IdeaPad Y460</> ($1,049 direct, ), the X420 uses a switching graphics technology. In other words, you have the choice of running a discrete graphics option (ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5450) for 3D intensive tasks, or getting the most out of the battery by switching to an integrated chipset (Intel GMA 4500MHD). The switching can be done manually via an ATI utility in Windows. By default, it automatically switches to the integrated chipset when the laptop is running on the battery; you can also force it to run on the ATI graphics at all times. On the other hand, the <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> uses Nvidia's Optimus switching technology, with which the decision is made for you based on which applications are running. It's automatic, seamless, and basically shuts the user out of the switching game. As for 3D performance, the X420 and <p>Asus UL80Vt-A1</> were split. The former performed better in 3DMark 06 tests, while trailing behind in actual gaming demos like Crysis and World in Conflict. The Lenovo Y460, which runs on a more powerful ATI chip, took top honors in gaming benchmark tests. I would give ATI a plug for improving high-definition playback, but both the Intel and ATI chipsets played back various 1080p video clips at high bit rates and in full screen, perfectly fine. With Crysis and World in Conflict, I would recommend playing them at low resolutions and cranking down on the special effects. MSI slid a big battery underneath the X420. So big, in fact, that it raises the laptop half-an-inch from the back. However, the 63WH battery still isn't as big as the one found in the Asus U30Jc-1A (84WH) and Asus UL80Vt-1A (84WH). Its battery capacity is more in line with that of the MacBook (63.5WH), and thus, battery scores reflect that. Draining in 7 hours 43 minutes on MobileMark 2007, the X420 is very battery efficient, although the Asus UL80Vt-1A (10:10) and <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> (8:00) lasted longer. With the ATI graphics running on battery, the X420 finished in 4 hours 31 minutes. The <p>MSI X-Slim X420</> placed portability above everything else by purging the optical drive and using a low-powered processor (fewer cooling fans). As a result, speeds were less than impressive compared to laptops that run on standard-voltage processors. And even with the power savings, there are full powered laptops that delivered better battery life. The <p>Asus U30Jc-A1</> is a better pick in this case, as it runs a Core i3 processor and delivered similar battery scores.
