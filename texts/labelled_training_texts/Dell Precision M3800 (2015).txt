The new iteration of the <p>Dell Precision M3800</> ($2,227.99 as tested) is a mobile workstation made for serious architecture, graphics, scientific, and engineering tasks. It's equipped with a powerful Intel Core i7 processor and an ISV-certified Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU, but that's not all. A high-resolution 4K screen and a Thunderbolt 2 port are improvements over last year's <p>Dell Precision M3800</>. It's a competent mobile workstation, and a good choice if you need a lot of screen real estate in a thin and light laptop. Design and Features The Precision M3800 is thin for a mobile workstation. At 0.71 by 14.75 by 10 inches (HWD), it has identical measurements to last year's model. The system weighs 4.15 pounds, which is much lighter than the 17-inch <p>Dell Precision M2800</> and lighter and smaller than the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad W540</>, our Editors' Choice mobile workstation. The system is made of premium materials, including carbon fiber on the bottom panel. The 15.6-inch indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) display is protected by edge-to-edge Corning Gorilla Glass NBT, and the 10-point touch screen is responsive. The display's Ultra-High-Definition (3,840-by-2,160) resolution lets you view much more than you can with the 1080p resolution of full HD screens. It also offers more on-screen real estate than the 2,880-by-1,800-resolution display on the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch Retina Display (2014)</>, or the 3K (2,880-by-1,620) screen on the Lenovo W540. You can view a 1080p HD video in a window at native resolution on the display, and still see your email and IM windows, all running simultaneously. The roomy screen is also a boon if you have to view architecture plans, scientific readouts, humungous spreadsheets, or multiple 1080p HD video streams for your work. The quality is excellent, with smooth gradients and solid colors. The system lacks the built-in color calibration tools that the Lenovo W540 and the <p>Toshiba Satellite P50T-BST2N01</> have, which may be a necessity if you need color matching for print media or broadcast video. Connectivity is excellent. There's a Noble security port, an SD card reader, a USB 2.0 port, and a USB 3.0 port on the right side of the system. Note that both USB ports are the same color, so you're going to have to look closely at the labels to see which is the faster USB 3.0 port. On the left, the system has a headset jack, an HDMI port, a Thunderbolt 2 port, and a second USB 3.0 port. All three USB ports have sleep-and-charge capability. A USB-to-Ethernet adapter is included for wired connections to your computer network, which is inconvenient, but a concession Dell had to make to keep the system's thin profile. The Thunderbolt 2 port will work as a mini DisplayPort, but its greatest asset is that you can share hard drive data and peripherals with the Macs and Windows workstations in your organization through the Thunderbolt 2 port. For wireless connectivity, the system has 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0. Internal access is not so good, however. Like the MacBook Pro, the Precision M3800 uses non-standard screw heads to close the bottom lid, effectively making it impossible for you to upgrade memory, swap out storage, or even change the battery. Your IT pros should have access to the internals after buying the correct tools, but you're probably better off using Dell's in-home/onsite service after remote diagnosis. The system comes with a one-year warranty, which is short for high-end business systems. The backlit keyboard is comfortable to use, though there's no numeric keypad. The wide touchpad is centered on the space bar, and is as responsive as the touch screen. The system comes with Windows 8.1 Pro pre-installed, with a USB stick instead of a recovery partition on the 256GB solid-state drive (SSD). You can downgrade to Windows 7 Professional on the same Microsoft license if your business hasn't standardized on Windows 8.1. The 16GB of system memory is plenty for large data sets and multi-gigabyte RAW graphics files. Performance The system comes with a quad-core Intel Core i7-4712HQ processor and ISV-certified Nvidia Quadro K1100M discrete graphics. It scored 2,664 points on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, so it's sufficiently speedy on day-to-day tasks. It took only 1 minute 19 seconds to complete the Handbrake video encoding test and 3:30 to complete the Adobe Photoshop CS6 test. Both times are very close to those of other high-end laptops and mobile workstations, like the Apple MacBook Pro (1:17 on Handbrake; 3:25 on CS6) and the Lenovo W540 (1:20 on Handbrake; 3:18 on CS6). Its score of 599 points on CineBench puts it behind the Toshiba P50T-BST2N01 (611 points) and the Lenovo W540 (637). While you likely won't be playing games on the M3800, its 3D gaming scores are adequate for a professional workstation. It returned frame rates of 22 frames per second (fps) on Heaven and 29fps on Valley, both at Medium-quality settings. That's marginally better than the integrated Iris Pro graphics in the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch Retina (22fps on Heaven; 23fps on Valley), though the Lenovo W540 (30fps on Heaven; 42fps on Valley) was measurably faster on the tests. Thus, the M3800 has enough power to qualify as a mobile workstation, though others in its class are marginally faster. Battery life was a mixed bag in testing. The system lasted 4 hours 53 minutes on our battery rundown test. That's an hour less than the Lenovo W540 and the previous iteration of the M3800. The class leader remains the Apple MacBook Pro, which lasted almost nine hours. However, 5 hours is still better than the <p>Dell Precision M2800</> (4:26) and the Toshiba P50T-BST2N01 (2:45). Overall, this year's <p>Dell Precision M3800</> is an improvement over the previous iteration in terms of connectivity, price, and screen resolution. Its battery life is not as long as last year's M3800, but that's to be expected, given the higher-resolution screen of the new model. If you absolutely need the extra real estate of a 4K screen, and you're willing to keep the AC adapter handy, the new M3800 is a good pick. The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad W540</> remains our Editors' Choice mobile workstation, thanks to its built-in color calibrator, longer battery life (and replaceable battery), easier expandability, and a slightly less-expensive price tag.
