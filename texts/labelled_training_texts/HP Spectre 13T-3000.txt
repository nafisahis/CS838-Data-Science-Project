In the short two years that ultrabooks have been around, there have been several premium designs brought forward, but they always seem to be paired with a premium price. Even systems like the Editors' Choice <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> and the top-rated <p>Acer Aspire S7-392-6411</> start in the $1,400 range. So it's particularly refreshing to see that the <p>HP Spectre 13T-3000</>, HP's flagship ultrabook, not only matches those premium systems in both specs and some performance, but it does so for a much more reasonable price. Design The Spectre 13T-3000 resembles other ultrabooks in most respects. It's extremely thin and light, measuring 0.59 by 12.75 by 8.66 inches (HWD) and weighing only 3.2 pounds. The Samsung Book 9 Plus (3.06 pounds) and Acer S7-392-6411 (2.87 pounds) are lighter, but not by much. The construction is all brushed aluminum, anodized in shades of brown혰a darker "Truffle Brown" for the lid and a beige "Champagne" color for the keyboard and palmrest. The result is a sleek looking, attractive laptop that offers a premium look and feel. Similar to competing ultrabooks, the Spectre 13T-3000 boasts a full-size backlit keyboard. Though the chiclet-style keyboard has the same silvery beige finish as the aluminum palmrest, the keycaps are actually made of plastic instead of metal. Despite this, the typing feel is pretty good given the limitations placed on ultrabooks, such as shallow depth of travel. The overall typing experience is pretty good, putting it in line with the <p>Asus Zenbook Prime Touch UX31A-BHI5T</>. The biggest difference seen on the Spectre 13T, however, is the trackpad. Windows 8 brought the trackpad front and center with its use of gesture controls, especially the use of swiping gestures that come in from the edges of the pad to access fundamental commands, such as switching from one app to the next and accessing the Windows Charms menu. HP makes those essential actions more intuitive and accessible with a trackpad that is much wider than the average. HP calls it Control Zone, with extended right and left sides of the touch surface, subtly distinguished with texturing and a matte finish that makes it easy to distinguish between the edges and center of the trackpad. The trackpad itself is one of the best I've used, with a surface that glides beneath the fingertips, a clickable surface that doesn't require too much force to press, and a sharp, satisfying click. Making the most of the touch capability of Windows 8, however, is the display. The 13.3-inch display supports touch, tracking up to 10 fingers at once, with 1,920-by-1,080 resolution offering full HD picture support. If 1080p isn't high enough resolution for your liking, there's also an option with 2,560-by-1,440 resolution for an additional $70. The audio quality is similarly high, with Beats Audio providing some of the best clarity and volume range I've heard from an Ultrabook. Features The Spectre 13T-3000 comes with a full assortment of ports, boasting two USB 3.0 ports, a full-size HDMI out, mini Display Port, and an SD card slot. A headset jack works with both stereo headphones and headsets for chatting, and a Kensington lock slot lets you lock down the device when in public. Inside, the Spectre 13T-3000 is outfitted with dual-band 802.11-AC Wi-Fi, which offers about as good a wireless connection as you can get in a laptop right now, along with Bluetooth 4.0 for pairing devices wirelessly. The slim Spectre 13T-3000 is equipped with a 128GB solid-state drive (SSD), with a decent amount of free space for storing all of your files and programs. The 128GB size is certainly smaller than the 500GB hybrid drives offered in some less expensive ultrabooks, but for an ultrabook with only an SSD, 128GB is par for the course--it's the same capacity seen in the <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> and the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (2013)</>. HP isn't stingy with the extras, either. Included in the price of the laptop is a fairly standard selection of preinstalled software, but there are a few stand out items, like a free 12-month subscription to McAfee LiveSafe service, 50GB of free cloud storage through Box with no expiration date, and a complimentary copy of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5. HP also covers the Spectre 13T-3000 with a two-year limited warranty for parts and labor. Performance The Spectre 13T-3000 is outfitted with the same 1.6GHz Intel Core i5-4200U processor found in the Acer S7-392-6411 and Samsung Book 9 Plus, paired with 4GB of RAM. As a result, the performance between the three was fairly similar, with the Spectre 13T scoring 4,836 points in PCMark 7 and 2.41 points in Cinebench. By comparison, the Acer S7-392-6411 completed PCMark 7 with 4,816 points, and Cinebench with 2.51 points; while the Samsung Book 9 Plus pulled just a little further ahead with 4,907 points (PCMark 7) and 2.5 points (Cinebench). While basic performance was similar among the three, the Spectre 13T-300 did fall behind in multimedia performance, completing Handbrake in 1 minute 33 seconds, and Photoshop in 13 minutes 50 seconds혰well behind the Acer S7and Samsung 9 Plus. As with most ultraportables, the Spectre 13T-3000 uses Intel's integrated graphics solution (Intel HD Graphics 4400), which offers pretty good all-around graphics performance, but not well enough for demanding specializations, like gaming. In 3DMark 11, the Spectre 13T-300 scored 1,680 points (Entry) and 293 points (Extreme), which puts it right in line with both the <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> and the <p>Acer Aspire S7-392-6411</>. Where the <p>HP Spectre 13T-3000</> did particularly well was battery life. With an internal 4-cell Lithium Ion battery, the Spectre 13T-3000 lasted just shy of 9 hours (8:58) in our timed battery rundown test. The competing systems all fell behind혰the <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> (8:15) and the <p>Acer Aspire S7-392-6411</> (8:22) both came close혰though everything takes second place to the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch</> (Mid-2013), which lasted an impressive 11:26. Despite this, the Spectre 13T-3000 is actually one of the longest-lived of any of the premium ultrabooks. The fact that the <p>HP Spectre 13T-3000</> is so competitive with top systems like the <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> and the <p>Acer Aspire S7-392-6411</> is something of a testament to HP's design and manufacturing acumen. While these systems are extremely similar in specifications, performance, and quality of design, the HP Spectre 13T-300 starts at $999.99, a few hundred dollars less than the competition. To sell this quality of a product at that more reasonable price is no small feat, but to do so while offering longer battery life and similar performance makes it one of the better ultrabooks on the market today. The <p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus</> remains the Editors' Choice due to its superior display and faster multimedia performance, but if those features don't grab you, the HP Spectre 13T-300 is a more affordable alternative.
