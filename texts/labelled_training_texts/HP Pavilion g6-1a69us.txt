There are several new budget laptops rolling out right now, and HP has several compelling models, like the <p>HP Pavilion g7-1033cl</> ($649.99 list, 4 stars) and Editors' Choice <p>HP Pavilion dv6-6013cl</> ($649.99 list, 4.5 stars). Add to this strong Spring line-up the <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> ($629.99 direct). It brings a distinctive two-toned styling, strong performance, some of the best battery life offered in the budget category. Design The <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> has a sleek lid with rounded corners, and a stylish two-toned chassis. It's constructed of plastic, but is surprisingly rigid, without the flexing that often makes similar laptops feel cheap. While our review unit came in a sleek charcoal gray, the g6-1a69us is also available in purple, blue, pink, and pewter. The full-sized keyboard has a traditional layout with adjoining keys, but thanks to a raised square profile on each key, the typing experience was more like that of a chiclet keyboard. The layout is fairly standard, though HP has squeezed the four arrow keys into three keys' worth of space, with the up and down arrows getting only half-sized keys. The g6-1a69us's touchpad is molded seamlessly into the palm rest, but is easily distinguished by a textured pattern of raised dots. It supports multitouch gestures, letting you zoom and scroll with a flick of the fingers. There are separate right and left mouse buttons at the bottom of the touchpad, which click easily without being too firm. The 15.6-inch widescreen is large enough to support side by side windows (perhaps your browser and Word) or movie without putting large black bars on the screen. The 1,366 by 768 resolution means that DVD playback and streaming video should be crisp and clear in 720p. In addition to the display, the Pavilion g6 also comes equipped with SRS Premium Sound software, and while the speakers themselves won't satisfy connoisseurs of high quality soundit distorts at high volumes and has very little bassthey are good enough for watching a movie without headphones. Features The 500GB 5,400rpm hard drive is in line with most other laptops in this category, as it's the same size and speed of the drives found in the <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</> ($599 list, 3.5 stars) and HP dv6-6013cl. What's not as common on a laptop in this price range is the dual-layer DVD burner that includes LightScribe label printing. The g6-1a69us also comes with a basic assortment of ports and connectors: 3 USB 2.0 ports, VGA output, HDMI output, headphone and microphone jacks, a built-in Web cam, and an integrated card reader that supports SD and MMC formats. Built-in 802.11n Wi-Fi should get you online without a problem, but there's a wired Ethernet jack on the side that you can use as well. The g6-1a69us comes with several programs and utilities pre-installed. Some will be useful, like a trial version of Office 2010, and a 60-day trial of Norton Internet Security. Others will fall somewhere between useless and irritating, like the Blio ebook reader application, a collection of sample games from WildTangent, and a few HP branded offerings, like the HP MovieStore, HP Music Store and HP PictureMover. You'll also see one or two desktop links to websites like eBay. While you may want to keep one or two of these programs, I'd personally set aside some time to clear them off of the new laptop. Performance The g6-1a69us is equipped with a 2.53 GHz dual-core Intel Core i3-380M processor, paired with 4GB of RAM. It's the same processor seen in the <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</> ($599.99 list, 4 stars) and <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</>. In our CineBench R11.5 and PCMark Vantage tests, the g6-1a69us ranked right alongside other top laptops, scoring 2.08 points and 5,212 points, respectively. By comparison, the <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</> scored 2.07 points in CineBench and 5,148 in PCMark, while the Acer AS5742-6475 scored 2.10 in CineBench and 5,639 in PCMark. Even in laptops with similar parts performance can vary widely, but the g6-1a69us will tackle day-to-day tasks with no problem. In multimedia tasks the <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> proved to be a strong performer. In our HandBrake video encoding test, the Pavilion g6 completed the test in 3 minutes even, identical to the <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</> and <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</>. In our Photoshop CS5 test, the Pavilion g6 completed our preset series of filters and manipulations in 5 minutes 21 seconds, beating out the both the <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</> (5:35) and <p>Lenovo G560-0679AKU</> (5:27). For the user who occasionally needs to touch up a photo or trim a video, the <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> will be up to the job. For graphics processing, the <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> relies on Intel's integrated graphics. It's the same graphics solution found in the <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</>, and the Pavilion g6-1a69us manages to produce slightly better scores in 3DMark06. The Pavilion g6-1a69us scored 1,985 at medium resolution and 1,759 at native. The <p>Acer Aspire AS5742-6475</> scored 1,888 at medium and 1,617 at native. These scores fell far behind the scores of the <p>HP Pavilion dv6-6013cl</>, which utilized the improved integrated graphics of a second-generation Intel processor, and scored 4,116 at medium resolution and 1,748 at native resolution. Unlike the dv6-6013cl, however, the g6-1a69us was unable to run either Crysis or Lost Planet 2, our gaming tests. In our MobileMark 2007 battery life test, the <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> ran down from fully charged to completely dead in 5 hours 8 minutes with a 6-cell (47Wh) battery. This plants it squarely among the best laptops in the budget category, like the Acer AS5742-6475 (5:01), which has a similar 6-cell (48Wh) battery and HP dv6-6013cl (5:17) that has a larger 55Wh battery. From its sleek design to its strong performance, the <p>HP Pavilion g6-1a69us</> is certainly a leader in the current crop of budget laptops. If you're looking for a good general-use laptop, the g6-1a69us is worth considering, but don't discount the <p>HP Pavilion g7-1033cl</>, which offers similar performance with a larger 17-inch display, or the Editors' Choice <p>HP Pavilion dv6-6013cl</>, which takes top honors for its class-leading construction, second-gen Intel processor, and battery life.
