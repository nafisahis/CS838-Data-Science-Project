The <p>Disney Netpal by ASUS</> is proof that someone can really design a netbook around kids. It's not the tiny profile, the Princess pink colors, or even the 10 customizable, Disney desktop themes that impresses me, but rather the software that comes bundled with it. Your child is immersed in a Disney environment that's completely different from the usual Windows XP desktop experience; one which, as a parent, you'll have complete control of through the netbook's remarkable parental controls. The Netpal itself is too small for an adult, but I have no qualms about recommending this to any child (ages 6 to 12), especially a Disney fan. Design The Princess design is tailor made for any child who has ever dressed up as one. Obviously, it's not as gender-neutral as the <p>Dell Mini Nickelodeon Edition</>, although Disney is selling a plain blue version that should appeal more to little boys. Floral patterns, which form the shape of princesses, tiaras, and hearts, can be detected throughout the lid and palm rest area. The Netpal is based on the <p>ASUS EeePC 1008HA (Seashell)</>, except it took away some screen real estate (from 10-inches to 8.9-inches) and shrunk the keyboard (92% to 89%) in order to make it more child-friendly, not to mention paring down costs. Traditional netbooks like the <p>Toshiba mini NB205</> and the <p>Sony VAIO VPC-W11XX</> are more adult-oriented, although they do come in pink versions. At 2.4 pounds, it's a shade lighter than the Mini Nickelodeon (2.6 lbs), the NB205 (2.9 lbs), and the <p>HP Mini 5101</> (2.9 lbs). I can understand a smaller keyboard, since the hands of a child tend to be small and slender. Taking away screen real estate, however, will not improve your child's vision. The 8.9-inch widescreen reminds me of when the first netbooks came to market, specifically the <p>Asus EeePC 4G</>. Most netbooks, including the Mini Nickelodeon, average 10-inch widescreens and 1,024-by-600 resolutions. And there's a huge number of netbooks being sold with 11.6 and 12-inch widescreens, such as the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad S12</>, <p>HP Mini 311</>, <p>Asus EeePC 1101HA</>, and <p>Samsung N120 (12GBK)</>. Every key on the Netpal is positioned in its correct form and properly proportioned according to traditional keyboard standards. The chrome mouse buttons are a little difficult to press, but your child shouldn't have a problem adjusting. Features The real value here is in the bundled software. A number of Disney themes are also available, including Hannah Montana, Wall-E, Cars, Jonas Brothers, Lilo and Stitch, and TinkerBellto name a few. Although the Mini Nickelodeon offers a 15-month trial subscription of McAfee's Family Security Center, the Netpal includes Disney's own parental controls, which don't expire. The software suite goes well beyond parental controls, in fact. Your child basically gets his or her own Windows user account (Parents would have a separate "master" account, locked by a password), which logs into the Disney environment. From there, you will find a custom Web browser, calendar app, an email client (syncs with numerous POP mail accounts), and multiple games. You can permit access to any number of applications and folders (i.e. My Documents and My Pictures) from Windows (Disney launches them from within its environment), and your child wouldn't be able crossover to the Windows environment unless the master password is entered. More importantly, the parental controls are more vast and comprehensive than what I saw on the <p>Dell Mini Nickelodeon Edition</>. Parents can choose which e-mail addresses their kids can receive e-mail from, block any Website, and add (or remove) any application to an approved list. They can delegate specific days and times when the child is allowed to use a particular program or access the web. For example, I can program the controls to prevent my child from using the Web or a specific program during weekdays, from 8a.m. to 3p.m. If you twist and turn the Netpal, the feature set looks like an average netbook. The three USB ports are standard netbook fare, and the 160GB hard drive should be than enough for a year's worth of schoolwork. Every other featurea built-in Webcam, 4-in-1 card reader, VGA-out, and Ethernet portare consistent with its peers. Your child won't need anything more than that. Performance Though it skimps on screen real estate, the Netpal doesn't do the same in processing parts. The combination of the 1.6GHz, Intel Atom N270 processor and 1GB of memory can be found across most netbooks. They NB205 and the 5101 have a marginally higher-clocking processor than the Netpal, but parents would be hard pressed to notice any performance differences in the real world. Upgrading the memory yourself is simple: You only have to remove to screws from a bottom panel. The Netpal performed as well as any other netbook, achieving similar SYSMark 2007 scores as the Mini Nickelodeon and Toshiba NB205. In video encoding tests, the Toshiba NB205 and Mini Nickelodeon have the minor edge. Since it's based on the ASUS 1008HA design, the battery is not removable, which can be a good thing if you don't want your child playing with a fire hazard. The battery is made of Lithium Polymer, and even though its 28Wh capacity is similar to that of the Mini Nickelodeon (27Wh, Lithium Ion), the Netpal cranked out more battery life. A MobileMark 2007 score of 5 hours 30 minutes easily beats that of the Mini Nickelodeon (2:55). However, higher capacity, removable batteries are available with Toshiba NB205, Mini Nickelodeon, and the HP 5101, the last of which delivered battery life ranges between 7-8 hours. Parents can get tired of shopping around for third party software that promises to protect their children from online dangers. The <p>Disney Netpal by ASUS</> eases these concerns by having these parental controls already setup, for free. A number of themes, games, and useful applications are included in a slightly undersized netbook form factor, but runs as fast and as long as some of the best in the market.
