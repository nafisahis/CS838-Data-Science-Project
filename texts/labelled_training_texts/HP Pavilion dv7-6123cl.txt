The <p>HP Pavilion dv7-6123cl</> ($999.99 at Costco) is a laptop that gives you Core i5 power and all-day unplugged computing, as well as cool extras that include a durable finish and better-than-average audio output. But it comes up short when it comes to features and graphics horsepower. Design As with many of the latest Pavilion notebooks, including the dv6-6113cl ($699.99 list, 3.5 stars) and dm4-2015dx ($699.99 list, 3.5 stars), the dv7-6123cl has a dark umber aluminum-clad lid and keyboard deck, both of which are durable and cool to the touch. The lid is adorned with the requisite backlit HP logo and has smooth, rounded corners. At 7.1 pounds, the dv7-6123cl is considerably lighter than other 17-inch notebooks, including the 8.1-pound <p>Dell XPS 17</> ($1,670 direct, 3.5 stars). The dv7-6123cl's nine-cell battery adds an extra half an inch to its overall height, causing it to measure two inches at its thickest point. The massive keyboard is of the isolated-key (chiclet) variety and contains a dedicated number pad. As with most HP keyboards there's a bit of flex when you type, but keystrokes do not feel spongy at all. The traditional two-button touchpad, outlined by thin backlit borders, provides good cursor control and solid mouse button clicks. There's a fingerprint reader below the keyboard on the right, and a power button and browser hotkey up top on the left. The big 17.3-inch display is bright and delivers bold colors, but it has a maximum resolution of 1,600 by 900, which means it cannot display HD content at 1080p. The <p>Acer Aspire AS8950G-9839</> ($1,499.99 street, 4 stars), on the other hand, offers a full HD (1,920-by-1,080) screen, but it will cost you around $500 more. The dv7-6123cl features Beats Audio, which uses a combination of software and hardware to produce an enhanced audio experience. A silver speaker bar above the keyboard, two speakers in the base, and a subwoofer on the bottom of the chassis pump out loud, crisp mid and high tones; you don't get big, booming, bass with it, but the low end is improved and overall the sound is much fuller than what you get with most notebook systems. Features As far as I/O ports, there are VGA, HDMI, and Ethernet ports on the left side of the dv7-6123cl, as well as two USB 3.0 ports, two headphone jacks, and a microphone jack. On the right side of the chassis are two USB 2.0 ports and a DVD burner with LightScribe labeling technology. Missing is an eSATA port for connecting to external storage devices. An SD/MMC card reader is located on the front edge of the chassis, and the upper screen bezel holds an HP TruVision HD webcam. The dv7-6123cl has 802.11n Wi-Fi capabilities, but you don't get Bluetooth networking with this model like you do with the dv7-6143cl ($999.99 list, 4 stars), and there's no support for WiMAX broadband. The 640GB hard drive provides a good amount of storage for digital data, but at 5,400rpm it is on the slow side. You can free up even more room if you remove some of the bloatware that comes preloaded on the drive, including eBay adware, numerous games, and limited trial software. In addition to Windows 7 Home Premium you get Cyberlink YouCam (for the webcam). Because the dv7-6123cl is sold exclusively at Costco you get a two-year warranty at no additional charge (the standard manufacturer's warranty is one year). Costco members can also take advantage of Costco's Concierge service, which provides toll-free technical support and a 90-day return policy. Performance Powered by Intel's second-generation Core i5-2410M processor (running at (2.3GHz) and 6GB of RAM, the dv7-6123cl turned in middling scores on our benchmark tests. Its PCMark 7 score of 2,221 was right in line with that of the <p>Asus U46E-BAL5</> (2,215), but the system couldn't keep pace with Core i7â€“based desktop replacements such as the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Thunderbolt)</> ($2,199 direct, 4 stars), which scored an impressive 8,315. Likewise, the HP's CineBench R11.5 score of 2.55 was just a bit lower than we saw on the U46E-BAL5 (2.59) and <p>Samsung QX411-W01</> (2.56), but considerably lower than those attained by the dv7-6163cl (4.94) and MacBook Pro (5.07). On our Photoshop CS5 test, the dv7-6123cl's time of 4 minutes and 10 seconds was identical to the results of the QX411-W01 and U46E-BAL5, while the more powerful <p>Dell XPS 15z</> ($1,534 direct, 4 stars) and dv7-6163us ($849.98, 3.5 stars) needed 3:40 and 3:52, respectively. The dv7-6123cl's Handbrake time of 1:54 was consistent with the other Core i5 notebooks, but a bit slower than the dv7-6163us (1:36). The dv7's integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 performed as expected, which is to say it suffices for playing video but lacks the chops needed for the latest games. The laptop managed just 17.7 frames per second (fps) on our Crysis test and 18.6fps on our Lost Planet 2 test (both were run at medium quality settings at a resolution of 1,024 by 768). By way of comparison, the <p>Dell XPS 15z</>, fueled by a discrete Nvidia GeForce GT 525M graphics card, churned out 59fps on Crysis and 37fps on Lost Planet 2. The dv7-6123cl's big nine-cell battery lasted an incredible 9 hours 14 minutes on MobileMark 2007, handily beating the QX-411W01 (8:48), XPS 15z (6:22), and U46E-BAL5 (7:19). Due to its size, it's doubtful that the dv7-6123cl will spend a lot of time away from the desk, but it's good to know that you can expect a full day's worth of battery power nonetheless. The <p>HP Pavilion dv7-6123cl</> delivers decent productivity performance and excellent battery life, but it isn't going to blow you away with raw computing or graphics power. Its feature set is also stingy compared to similarly priced 17-inch notebooks, including its sibling, the dv7-6143cl, which costs the same but offers a more powerful processor, discrete graphics, and a Blu-ray drive. But if you're looking for a thinner, lighter, and slightly smaller desktop replacement notebook that can handle games, Dell's XPS 15z is your best bet.
