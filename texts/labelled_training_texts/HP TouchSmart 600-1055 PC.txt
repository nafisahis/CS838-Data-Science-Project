The <p>HP TouchSmart 600-1055 PC</> ($1,599 list) is HP's third generation of TouchSmart PCs for the home. HP pioneered touch computing for the home and each successive generation has gotten better. The latest model combines HP's Touch experience with Microsoft's support built into Windows 7 (a.k.a., Microsoft Touch Pack for Windows 7). The result is a system that I can finally recommend without reservation to both the touch aficionado and the average home user, and earns it our Editors' Choice for mainstream all in one desktops. Design The TouchSmart 600 looks like an updated version of the IQ TouchSmart PCs (like the IQ816) that we've seen in the past. It has a 23-inch, 16:9 1080p HD screen, which it uses to great effect. The front panel is pretty sparse: Only the "Home" key shows up on the panel. The power button is on the right side, above the slot-loading Blu-ray drive, and most of the other ports are on the left, under a removable panel cover. Notable ports include the six USB ports, TV in, and S-Video and audio in. Aside from those, the new TouchSmart has a dedicated "game" port with composite video/audio in flanked by a HDMI in port. This is big. With this, you can hook up a Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, Sony Playstation 3, or even an older game console like a Sega DreamCast. The HDMI port is compatible with cable or satellite boxes as well. The system has an AV button both on the remote and on the system so you can switch inputs easily. The TouchSmart 600 is Ã¼ber-connected. Features Our review unit, the top-of-the-line 600-1055 model: the system is powered by a 2.13GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P7450 processor, has 4GB of DDR3 memory, Nvidia GeForce GT230M graphics, and has a decent 750GB hard drive. There's also a 600-1050 model with a slower processor and lower powered graphics, and a TouchSmart 300 series line with a smaller 20-inch screen. Both TouchSmart 600s also come with a TV tuner, making it HDTV-capable out of the box. Just hook up an external antenna and voila; you have free over the air (OTC) HDTV on your TouchSmart. The screen is bright and handles action well: It displayed a decent, streak-free1080p picture on our test discs like X-Men: The Last Stand and Mission Impossible. The 600 series' little brother, the TouchSmart 300 series, has a smaller 20-inch touch screen. Less expensive versions of 600 and 300 series TouchSmart PCs make do without options like the HDMI port, Blu-ray, or TV tuners. One nice feature is that you can watch live TV in HP's TouchSmart interface: in the past you had to quit out of TouchSmart Home and retrun to Windows to watch Hulu, TV, and movies in Vista Media Center or in Internet Explorer. The system's wireless keyboard slides right under the TouchSmart's screen into a little cubbyhole. There's an adjustable ambient lighting bar under the screen to light the keyboard in dark rooms. The screen tilts to accommodate both people standing and those that slouch deep into the chair. There's also a VESA mount option, and unlike previous models you can no wremove the feet so the screen looks cleaner when mounted on a wall. Also new is a pivot on the back "foot," so it's easier to pivot the screen to show to a group seated around the PC. All this adjustability make the TouchSmart a pleasure to use in almost any setting. The system's TouchSmart software is way better than that of last year's model, in large part because of Windows 7's touch enhancements. (The TouchSmart desktop is currently available for pre-order and will start shipping when Windows 7 launches later this month.) Within the TouchSmart Home interface, there's the usual weather widget, calendar, notes, browser, photos, videos, and music. The third generation adds interfaces for Hulu, NetFlix, Recipe Box (a unified interface for recipe Web sites), Live TV, and TouchSmart Link, a way to upload your digital photos directly from a Bluetooth phone. (The system comes with both 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities). Once loaded on the PC, you can arrange your photos with standard multitouch commands, like pivoting two fingers to rotate or pinching to zoom, and create quick JPEG collages with the Canvas widget. That way, you can share a bunch of photos at once with a few flicks of your finger. Speaking of sharing, the built-in Webcam has been improved with a vertical tilt mechanism, so both short and tall people can be seen. This is the point where I usually berate HP for putting a bunch of bloatware on the system. However in this case, I can't do that: the system is refreshingly free of bloatware, for the most part. While I really would like more than 60-days subscription for the Norton Internet Security suite, there's no Microsoft Office 60-day trial, eBay icons, or dialup offers mucking up the system. There is an app to help you find broadband ISPs and HP Games is still there, but that's a vast improvement over what used to be on the previous HP Pavilion and TouchSmart systems. Just about the only other things I'd count as bloatware are the NetFlix viewer and Skype, but the utility of those programs almost outweigh their possibly unwanted presence. Performance The system is powered by a 2.13GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P7450 processor, has 4GB of DDR3 memory, and has a decent 750GB hard drive. Although it isn't the fastest all in one PC out there, The TouchSmart is competitive in the space. The quad-core powered <p>Gateway One ZX6810-01</> is faster on all of our benchmark test, but the HP TouchSmart 600 is certainly speedy compared with the rest of the dual-core powered competition. The TouchSmart 600 completed the Windows Media Encoder test in just over a minute (1:05) and the PhotoShop CS4 test in over two (2:18). These are very good scores; you'd have to trade up to a quad-core system to get significantly faster. The HP's PCMark Vantage score is on the high side for an all in one (4,318 points). PC Gaming isn't the TouchSmart's strong suit: World in Conflict (22 fps) and Crysis (18 fps) were both unplayable at our standard test setting. This is par for the course on all in ones; beside, you can always use the dedicated game port to hook up a gaming console to the screen. The HP TouchSmart 600-1055 is a lot more polished than other all-in-one touchscreen PCs like the <p>Dell Studio One 19</> and Gateway ZX6810-01. It also has a larger screen than the less expensive Dell One 19 and <p>Lenovo IdeaCentre A600 (3011-4BU)</> (the A600 isn't available with touch). The <p>Averatec D1200</> all-in-one PC has a larger screen, but it's not a touchscreen and there's no Blu-ray drive. The Apple iMac is $100 cheaper, but has weaker 3D graphics, and also lacks Blu-ray and touch. So basically, though the HP TouchSmart is the most expensive model here (mostly by $100-$200), it has the most features, and those features are integrated well. Thus the <p>HP TouchSmart 600-1055 PC</> replaces the Apple iMac as our mainstream all in one Editors' Choice. The third-generation TouchSmart can now happily move beyond the touch aficionado's domain and out to regular consumer users.
