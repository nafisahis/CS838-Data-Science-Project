The <p>Dell XPS 630</> ($1,269 direct) represents Dell's entry into the sub-$1,500 gaming PC space. Not everyone needs a $5,000+ gaming box, especially if you just want to play the games and don't care much about frame rates. You won't be raving about the Dell's blazing performance at 1,920-by-1,200 resolution, but you will be able to say, "I can play Crysis." The unit can also be fitted later with either ATI CrossFire or nVidia SLI dual-card systems, so this is a gaming box that you'll be able to upgrade it your heart's desire. It's a smidge more expensive than its direct competition, but that extra $170 is totally worth it. Most gaming boxes at this price point come with only one graphics card, and the XPS 630 is no different. It comes with a dual-core Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 processor and a 512MB nVidia GeForce 8800 GT cardone of the better single graphics cards out there. You can add another 8800 GT (for $300 more) to get nVidia's SLI performance configuration. The XPS 630 is notable because although it uses the nVidia nForce 650 SLI motherboard chipset, it's also compatible with the ATI Radeon CrossFire dual-card solution. This gives both ATI and nVidia fans options for configuring or upgrading. The system is housed in an ATX-style chassis, with a brushed aluminum trim and attractive front panel with metal mesh cooling vents. The front-panel bezel is available in black (as in our test model) or red. Like the XPS 720, the XPS 630 opens with a quick pull on a latch that's conveniently located on top. The inside of the system is neat, with mesh-wrapped cables. (The mesh also keeps the cables from impeding airflow.) The cables are full length, unlike the shortened cables from boutique computer makers. That's fine, since this box is easy for an end user (who may need the longer cables for new components) to service and upgrade. The system comes with a 750W power supply, so it will support dual graphics cards and multiple hard drives. You'll need a screwdriver to add expansion cards, but the rest is easy to get to, and tool-less. The three extra hard drive sleds are tool-less, though the ones in the <p>HP Blackbird 002</> feel better and seem more durable. But apart from that, this is a great computer for you to upgrade yourself. Even with a performance-oriented nVidia GeForce 8800 GT graphics card, the XPS 630 is pretty quiet. The fans spool up on start-up but soon slow down to a quiet level. In addition to all the interior perks, the XPS 630's ATX chassis features Dell's LightFX 2.0 case lighting. That's one technology from the Alienware-Dell alliance that has trickled down to this Dell mainstream system. We've seen these case lights before, but on higher-end boxes like the XPS 720. You can change the colors or turn them off in five zones, so you can make your XPS 630 look unique. Although the ability to change the lighting color on the front of the case is pure indulgence, in the back the ports (USB, DVI, audio, etc.) are also lit. This makes it easier to plug or unplug gaming peripherals like keyboards or gamepads, and really helps when you're crouched under your desk trying to find out why the printer stopped printing, or when you lose the network connection in a darkened room. Other Dell XPS perks are still here. You get the XPS specialized support line, XPS accessory kit (mouse pad, case for CDs/DVDs, earphones, and the like), DataSafe Online Backup (10GB free for a year), and a 15-month subscription to McAfee Internet Security. As this isn't billed as a multimedia system, Adobe Elements Studio is optional, as is the 19-in-1 card reader we got with our review unit. How is the performance? Two words: Worth it. The XPS 630 produces playable numbers in Crysis at 1,280-by-1,024, yielding 58 frames per second. (For first person shooters like Crysis, 60 fps is considered playable.) This frame rate is notable because even dual graphics card systems like the Alienware Area 51 ALX (an $8,000 system) have trouble playing Crysis. The XPS 630's World in Conflict score is even better: 57 fps (numerically lower, but real-time strategy games like WiC play fine at 30 fps or better). Performance at 1,920-by-1,200 resolution was predictably slow (Crysis, 5 fps, WiC, 17 fps), but that's with all the eye candy turned up to high. Even $8,000 systems may have trouble with this test down the road. When I added a second 8800 GT card, the 1,920-by-1,200 score improved to a claimed 47 fps while I was playing Crysis, but the benchmark test screen showed a much lower score. It looks to me as if the SLI on Crysis is still buggy. Once nVidia makes the drivers more stable, I'd consider the addition of another GeForce 8800 GT card for SLI performance. While the <p>Dell XPS 630</> is mainly a gaming box, we ran the PC through our usual high performance test regimen, which includes BAPCo's SYSmark 2007 Preview benchmark test. The XPS 630 performed well, outpacing rivals like the <p>Gateway FX7020</> and the <p>Velocity Micro Edge M40</> on the SYSmark tests (e-learning, Office producivity, and 3D modeling). The XPS 630 lagged behind the Velocity Micro on the Video Creation test, but then again the VM costs twice as much and has a faster hard drive RAID array which is beneficial to video production. The XPS 630 is no one-trick pony: It will speedily perform all the day-to-day tasks you expect out of a mainstream system, while giving you the gaming performance you crave. The XPS 630's multimedia performance wasn't slouchy at all. It completed the Windows Media Encoder test in 1 minute 8 seconds, which is very good. Even though the processor is "only" dual corea 2.66-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 Penrynits use of Intel's new 45nm architecture makes it competitive with systems running the quad-core AMD Phenom 9600 processor. The E8200 also helped the XPS 630 attain a class-leading 32-second Photoshop CS3 test result. This "gaming" PC is fully equipped to double as a high-end consumer multimedia PC. Speaking of multimedia PCs, the most direct competitor to the XPS 630 is the <p>Gateway FX7020</> ($1,100 list). The FX7020 has a TV tuner and a quad-core Phenom 9600 processor, but the benchmark test results show us that overall, the XPS 630 is a better performer. Besides, a TV tuner is an optional luxury on a gaming box. Just about the only big advantage the FX7020 has over the XPS 630 is that the FX is available at big-box stores, whereas you'll have to wait for Dell to build and deliver an XPS 630. The XPS 630 trumps the FX7020 on SLI and CrossFire upgradability, since the FX7020 has only one PCIe x16 slot. The XPS 630 also has a longer Internet Security subscription, though hard-core gamers will probably uninstall McAfee to put less load on the CPU and free up some hard drive space. Sure, the XPS costs about $170 more than the FX7020, but it's so worth the money. The XPS 630 trumps even boxes that cost double the price, like the $2,980 <p>Velocity Micro Edge M40</>. The M40 comes with an AMD Phenom 9600 and dual ATI Radeon HD 3870 graphics cards in a CrossFire configuration, but the XPS 630 is still the overall performance winner. The <p>Dell XPS 630</> finally shows that you can get a gaming performance system for under $2,000. Heck, this shows that under $1,500 is the sweet spot for the frugal high-end gamer. Sure, you could build it yourself for less, but then you'd have to assemble it and be your own tech support. That's a lot of time and effort for a savings of maybe $150 to $200. At those rates, you may be better off spending a couple hundred extra bucks for a system that is perfectly workable out of the box and is fully capable of being upgraded later if you want higher frame rates or want to play games with more detail. The XPS 630 is that system. Check out the <p>Dell XPS 630</>'s test scores.
