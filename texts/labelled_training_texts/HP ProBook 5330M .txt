It would be easy to look at the <p>HP ProBook 5330M </>($899 direct), with its slim profile and metal-clad exterior, and brush it off as another design emulating Apple. But you should never judge a notebook by its cover. Thanks to an Intel Core i5-2520M processor and a fortress worth of security features, beneath its seductive Spartan exterior the <p>HP ProBook 5330M </>is a solid professional laptop. Design Though the ProBook 5330M's unadorned aluminum lid does bear a resemblance to that of the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Thunderbolt)</> ($2,199 direct, 4 stars), when open the laptop looks distinctly edgier: all right angles, highlighted by two-tone bare metal. The ProBook 5330M's magnesium chassis gives it a solid feel, and the black soft-touch coating on the underside of the laptop allows for a comfortable grip and traction on all sorts of surfaces. Measuring a compact 0.99 by 12.91 by 8.86 inches (HWD) and weighing only 3.99 pounds, the ProBook 5330M is easily carried in a laptop bag. The 13.3-inch screen has a resolution of 1,366 by 768, ideal for reading documents, viewing photos, and enjoying videos up to 720p. The roomy multitouch touchpad, which is accompanied by two soft mouse buttons, is smooth to the touch and responsive to gestures, and its gray plastic surface makes it easy to distinguish even in low-light situations. Speaking of low light, the ProBook 5330M comes with a full-size backlit keyboard, and its square black keys provide a comfortable typing experience similar to the one you get with the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</> ($1,399.99 direct, 3.5 stars), though the ProBook's keycaps aren't sculpted. The no-frills look is made even more extreme by HP's having minimized the appearance of any indicator lights. The only ones that remain are small, subtle indicators for Wi-Fi and hard drive activity, and lights on four buttons on the chassis for powering the laptop on and off, toggling the internal Wi-Fi radio, muting audio volume, and activating HP's QuickWeb interface. In fact, when the pinprick LEDs aren't lit, they virtually disappear. This contributes to the machine's understated elegance. The only concern this chassis raises is heat. While running some of our more demanding performance benchmarks, the ProBook's fan became very noisy, and temperatures rose as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (as measured by a Fluke IR thermometer). This isn't a deal breaker by any means, but the laptop may get too hot to comfortably use on your lap. Features The ProBook 5330M comes equipped with a 500GB 7,200rpm hard drive, which offers ample storage compared to the 320GB drives found in the <p>Dell Latitude E6420</>, the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</>, and the Editors' Choice <p>Dell Vostro 3350</> ($741 direct, 4 stars). The 5330M has the typical laptop feature set, with two standard USB 2.0 ports and a USB/eSATA combination port, HDMI and VGA outputs, a multiformat media card slot (SD, MMC), and a combined headphone and microphone jack. In addition to Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n Wi-Fi, the HP ProBook also supports both EV-DO and HSPA mobile broadband technologies. All of these connectivity options can be managed with the included HP Connection Center. For those who want to take advantage of their mobile broadband capability without the commitment of a two-year contract, you can use the HP Connection Center to use HP Data Pass, a prepaid option that lets you get online from anywhere, but only pay for short periods of service. In addition to all the usual ports and connectivity options, HP serves up a healthy side dish of security. Inside and out, you're provided with tools that protect your data and the system it's on. Whether it's authenticating your login with either facial recognition, a fingerprint swipe, or your Bluetooth phone, or providing cryptographic protection with a TPM chip, the ProBook has you covered. Its embedded security system also includes credential management, drive encryption, pre-boot security, and remote tools like Intel vPro and Computrace Pro for tracking and disabling a lost or stolen laptop. Hewlett-Packard also protects the ProBook 5330M with a one-year warranty covering parts and labor, and offers tech support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via a toll-free number. Performance The <p>HP ProBook 5330M </>may be thin, but it doesn't sacrifice processing power for battery life the way some notebooks do: by using ultra-low-voltage CPUs. Its processor is an Intel Core i5-2520M, a 2.5GHz dual-core chip, the same one found in the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</>, and similar to the one used in the <p>Dell Vostro 3350</>. Pairing this processor with 4GB of RAM helped the ProBook 5330M do well in our benchmark tests. In PCMark Vantage, our general-purpose performance test, it scored 7,257, whereas the Lenovo X1 scored 7,500 and the <p>Dell Vostro 3350</> only 6,688. In our CineBench R11.5 processor speed test, the ProBook 5330M scored 2.78, ahead of the Dell Vostro (2.56), but behind the Lenovo (2.85). Thanks to the Intel HD Graphics 3000 system in its processor, the ProBook 5330M packs a fair amount of video capability even without a discrete card. In 3DMark 06, our DirectX 9 video benchmark test, this integrated solution still produced scores of 4,014 at medium resolution and 1,928 at native resolution. By comparison, the <p>Dell Vostro 3350</> scored an impressive 5,672 at medium resolution and 4,648 at native settings, while the AMD RadeonÂ–equipped <p>HP EliteBook 8560p</> ($1,499.99 direct, 4 stars) scored only 5,477 (medium) and 3,795 (native). The best test of graphics performance is gaming, and the ProBook 5330M could only produce 14.9 frames per second in Lost Planet 2 at medium settings, and couldn't run Crysis at all. While this rules out serious gaming on the ProBook, it should still translate into basic graphics support for work-related programs, and casual gaming in your off-work hours. While gaming won't impact your workday much, multimedia authoring might. In our Photoshop CS5 photo editing test, the ProBook 5330M applied 12 filters and effects in 3 minutes 53 seconds, as compared to the Dell Vostro's 4:17. We saw similar performance in our Handbrake video encoding test, which the 5330M finished in 2 minutes 26 seconds. The Dell Vostro lagged behind with 2:33. In our MobileMark 2007 battery rundown test, the <p>HP ProBook 5330M </>lasted 3 hours 49 minutes, which isn't bad considering that it uses a four-cell 41Wh battery. That small battery helps reduce the ProBook 5330M's thickness, but it's a far cry from the 80Wh battery that gives the <p>Dell Vostro 3350</> its all-day battery life (9 hours 36 minutes). It is, however, comparable to what we've seen with other laptops in this category, like the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</> (3:10, 40Wh). All things considered, the <p>HP ProBook 5330M </>is a solid, competent notebook for small business professionals. If you need better battery life and graphics performance, the Editors' Choice <p>Dell Vostro 3350</> may be a better fit; and if your work involves heavy graphics processing or extreme number crunching, consider bumping up to an <p>HP EliteBook 8560p</>. But for sharp looks that will surely make an impression in meetings and the processing chops to shoulder a healthy workload, the ProBook 5330M will do the job.
