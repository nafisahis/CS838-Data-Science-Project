People have been using laptops to enjoy movies on the go for years. With an extra-wide screen and sweet-sounding Harman/Kardon speakers, the <p>Toshiba Satellite U845W-S410</> is targeted to be a dream laptop for movie lovers. But the oddly shaped ultrabook and its stretched dimensions may be more gimmicky than glamour and glitz. Design The U845W-S410's standout feature is its extra-wide screen. That super-wide screen offers the same 21:9 aspect ratio seen in CinemaScope movies, and is designed to play widescreen movies full-screen, sans letterboxing. The result is a display with the unusual resolution of 1,792 by 768essentially an 11-inch 1,366-by-768 display stretched an extra three inches wider. Measuring 0.83 by 14.5 by 7.9 inches (HWD), the Satellite U845W sits as wide as a 15-inch laptop, like the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Late 2011)</>, but the screen only has the height of an 11-inch screen, sitting even with the <p>Apple MacBook Air 11-inch (Thunderbolt)</>. Weighing 3.65 pounds, it's heavier than most 14-inch ultrabooks, but lighter than 15-inch laptops. The design, though stretched by the widescreen display, looks sharp, with tinted metal on the lid and chassis and a wide stripe of soft-touch texturing across the palmrest and the leading edge of the lid. The extra-wide screen is an interesting idea, but it raises plenty of questions. What about every other type of video, like non-Cinemascope movies, TV shows, YouTube videos, Netflix and Hulu offerings, or the hundreds of games optimized for the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio? Anything that doesn't conform to these wide dimensions will be letterboxed anyway, but with 1.5-inch wide black bars on either side instead of on top and bottom. This is assuming you've got everything set the usual 1,366-by-768 resolutionanything set higher will look fine width-wise, but will still be cut off along the top. Watching a standard 4:3 image will look even smaller: reruns from the age of classic TV could be displayed in a small square surrounded by black bars above and to the sides. If you zoom in, the sides of the screen will still be empty. For a high resolution picture without the wonky dimensions, the Editors' Choice <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX32VD-DB71 </>boasts a 1,920-by-1,080 resolution display with IPS technology, and its Core i5-equipped sibling, the <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX31A-R5102F</> has that same display at a price comparable to the U845W. While the U845W claims ultrabook status due to its thin profile and light weight, the reality is that it is too wide for convenient portability and too short for productive use. Despite the obvious focus on movies, you'll have to add your own external optical drive for DVD or Blu-ray playback. And with that extra width, the U845W won't fit into a case made for 14-inch laptops because it's too longwhile 15-inch laptop sleeves may fit it in one direction, but not the other. On either side of the keyboard, you'll see perforated grilles covering two built-in Harman/Kardon speakers. These premium speakers are paired with SRS Premium Sound, so the audio quality is actually quite good, but the layout is puzzling. With such a long chassis, why isn't there a 10-key numeric pad? Speaking of the keyboard, the typing experience is fairly decent, with quiet chiclet keys and a backlight that illuminates in the dark without a lot of light leakage. The black chiclet keys have a semi-gloss finish, and there's a bit of flexing when typing in the center of the keyboard. Features Design aside, the Satellite U845W is well-outfitted with features. Three USB 3.0 ports provide speedy connectivity for drives and peripherals, including one port with sleep and charge for powering other devices like your smartphone or tablet. A card reader on the front of the laptop supports SD and Memory Stick formats (SD/SDHC, MS/Pro), a compact Ethernet jack lets you plug in when the 802.11n Wi-Fi won't cut it, and there are the usual headphone and microphone jacks. Bluetooth 4.0 supports wireless headsets, speakers, and plenty of other peripherals. An HDMI-out port lets you connect to an external display, but you can also stream wirelessly with WiDi, provided you have the necessary Netgear Push2TV adapter. One disappointment is the lack of an optical drive. Though uncommon on 13-inch ultrabooks, slot-loading drives have made appearances in 14- and 15-inch models, like the <p>Dell Inspiron 14z (Summer 2012)</> and the <p>Samsung Series 5 Ultra (NP530U4B-A01US)</>, and the U845W seems a perfect fit, especially since so few streaming services offer the widescreen format this model is built around. The 500GB 5,400rpm hard drive and 32GB SSD cache are both the same capacity and speed as those seen in the <p>HP Envy 4-1043cl</> and <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U310</>. Toshiba preloads the Satellite U845W with plenty of extras, from Microsoft Office 2010 Starter and Google Chrome to 30-day trials of both Norton Internet Security and Toshiba Online Backup, a service that starts at $4.95 per month for 25GB of cloud storage. Toshiba also includes a few other branded services, like Toshiba BookPlace and App Place for purchasing ebooks and apps, respectively. Toshiba covers the Satellite U845W-S410 with a standard one-year warranty on parts and labor. Performance The Satellite U845W is equipped with a third-generation 1.7GHz Intel Core i5-3317U processor, the same dual-core processor seen in the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U310</> and the HP Envy 4, but offers better performance when paired with the Satellite U845w's 6GB of RAM. As a result, the Toshiba U845w scored 4,652 points in PCMark 7, ahead of both the <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U310</>(3,570 points) and the <p>HP Envy 4-1043cl</> (3,962 points). While CineBench scores were nearly identical (all hovering right around 2.40 points) since it's a pure processor speed test, the Satellite U845W's multimedia scores pulled ahead thanks to its extra RAM, completing Handbrake in 1 minute 58 seconds and Photoshop in 3 minutes 42 seconds. Equipped only with Intel's integrated graphics solution (Intel HD Graphics 4000), the Toshiba Satellite U845W offered acceptable graphics performance, but it was met with complications due to the unusual size and resolution of its display. For example, while 3DMark 2007 ran just fine and scored 5,833 points at medium resolution and detail settings, the second run was completed at 1,280 by 768 rather than the 1,792-by-768 native resolution of the display. Consequently, the second score was weighed anecdotally, but isn't considered a standard benchmark score. Similarly, in gaming tests, Lost Planet 2 ran fine at 1,028-by-768 resolution and medium detail settings, producing 20 frames per second (fps), but when dialed up to native resolution, it ran at 9fps with a width of 1,796 pixels while chopping off the top half of the picture. Again, this score is considered anecdotal and won't be included as an official benchmark score. Crysis, meanwhile, was unable to run successfully at any resolution. The Satellite U845W lasted 6 hours 42 minutes in MobileMark, which is decent but behind the <p>HP Envy 4-1043cl</> (7:45) and <p>HP Folio 13-1020us</> (8:47). While it won't get you through an entire workday, it provides enough longevity to enjoy a triple-feature, provided you aren't watching the super-extended versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If the <p>Toshiba Satellite U845W-S410</> were to be judged purely upon its performance and feature set, it would fare rather well, offering solid processing power and a healthy selection of ports and storage space. Unfortunately, the headlining feature of the laptopthe movie-friendly widescreen displaymars the overall user experience and distorts the dimensions of the laptop. For a superlative movie watching experience, the Editors' Choice <p>Asus Zenbook Prime UX32VD-DB71 </>offers a 1080p display and excellent speakers, while the similarly-equipped <p>Lenovo IdeaPad U310</> and <p>HP Envy 4-1043cl</> are both less cumbersome and less expensive.
