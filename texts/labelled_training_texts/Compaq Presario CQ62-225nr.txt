For an entry-level laptop, the <p>Compaq Presario CQ62-225nr</> ($499.99 list), available at Staples, has a lot going on. It offers a roomy 15.6-inch display, a full-size keyboard, and a modern dual-core processor. It also boasts a design that belies its entry-level status, since HP recently updated the design of its Pavilion and Envy laptops, and that makeover extends down to the bargain Compaq line. The Compaq CQ62 is one of the cheapest laptops you'll find at Staples, particularly if you exclude outdated models on clearance. The CQ62-225nr's Athlon II P320 processor is part of AMD's recently introduced 2010 Mainstream "Vision" platform, and the laptop provides fair performance for mainstream use along with fairly lengthy battery life. Most entry-level laptops harbor a deal-breaking flaw, but we can't find one on the CQ62-225nr, just a few minor annoyances. The lack of a Webcam will disappoint many users, and you also must make do without an HDMI port and a media card reader. The keys tend to squeak a bit, too. Design Gone are the glossy surfaces, chrome accents, and tapered edges of the Compaq and HP laptops of yore. These design elements have been replaced with a simpler, more unified design. The chassis is made from a textured plastic, which covers the lid and keyboard deck. The plastic used here is a matte black, and the texture resembles a fine, diamond pattern. Branding is kept to a minimum: One silver "Q" adorns the lid and small silver "Compaq" logo sits below the display. Two other small elements offer additional silver colored highlights: The thin power button above the keyboard and the two display hinges. The Compaq CQ62's textured plastic chassis and flat keyboard deck, recalls the look of recent Sony VAIO laptops, like the Sony VAIO VPC-EB13FX/BI ($799 list, ). Many 15.6-inch laptops squeeze in a dedicated number pad, which may hold some appeal to gamers and accountants, but HP doesn't outfit the Q62-225nr with one. The lack of a number pad allows for a roomy keyboard, with wide, flat keys. I did find that the keys began to squeak after an hour or two of use. I'm also not thrilled with HP's decision to add a column of shortcut keys along the left side of the keyboard. They offer one-button access to Windows Live Mail, CyberLink PowerDVD 9, your default browser, a print window, and a calculator. Although these shortcuts are handy I found myself hitting the print key instead of Shift, the calculator key instead of Alt, and caps lock instead of the "a" key. One of my least favorite aspects of past HP and Compaq laptops were their glossy touchpads, which didn't provide the best feel, since it created drag against your mousing finger. Thus, I was happy to report the CQ62-225nr features a touchpad with a matte finish, resulting in a better navigating experience. In fact, the textured design of the keyboard deck runs uninterrupted across the touchpad. Multitouch gestures are an increasingly common touchpad feature, but they're not offered here. Below the touchpad is a single mouse button, which was stiff and in some situations where I had to drag and drop files, required more effort than should be necessary. The CQ62-225nr weighs 5.5 pounds, which is standard for a 15.6-inch laptop. By comparison, the 15.6-inch <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S6051</> is slightly heavier at 5.6 pounds, while the 16-inch <p>HP Pavilion dv6-3010us</> ($699.98 list, ) weighs in at a trim 5.3 pounds. Features The 15.6-inch, LED backlit display features a 1,366-by-768 resolution, standard for the size and making it capable of displaying 720p HD content. DVD and HD video are immersive on the large display, and its ample screen real estate makes it easy to juggle multiple windows when multitasking. Above the display sits a placeholder for a Webcam, but, sadly, one is not present on the CQ62-225nr. Given the popularity of Skype and the low cost of a Webcam, the absence of one seems like a backwards move. Audio from integrated laptop speakers rarely impresses, and the Compaq CQ62 is no exception. The laptop's Altec Lansing stereo speakers reach a respectable level at max volume, but the sound is predictably tinny. The ports and connections on the CQ62-225nr are spartan: 3 USB 2.0 ports (two on the left and one on the right side) comprises all of the data ports. Sadly, an eSATA port and a media card reader are missing. Likewise, a VGA port is the only video-out option; no HDMI here. However, the CQ62-225nr does offer 802.11n Wi-Fi connectivity. Performance AMD recently introduced new CPUs for its 2010 Mainstream and 2010 Ultrathin platforms, which make up the internal components of the CQ62-225nr. The 2.1GHz Athlon II P320 is part of the former platform, which supports DDR3 memory, HyperTransport 3, and Direct X 11. Aiding the CPU is 3GB of DDR3 memory and integrated ATI Radeon HD 4250 graphics. A pedestrian but speedy 320GB, 7,200rpm hard drive rounds out the core specs for the CQ62-225nr. Compaq CQ62-225nr's performance will suffice for most budget buyers, and its quiet operation will certainly please anyone saddled with an older laptop whose cooling fans crank up at the slightest of tasks. Throughout testing, the Compaq CQ62's cooling fans remained blissfully still and silent the vast majority of the time. Still, the CQ62-225nr obviously can't compete with laptops that cost a few hundred dollars more and offer Intel Core i3 and Core i5 processors or AMD's Phenom II processor. Its PCMark Vantage score of 3,291 trailed Core i3, i5, and Phenom II-based models by healthy margins wasn't a surprise. It trailed the <p>Asus UL50VF-A1</> ($850 street, ), which uses a consumer ultra-low-voltage (CULV) Intel Core 2 Duo SU7300, on the PCMark Vantage tests by 12 percent. The Dell iM501R-13230BK ($599.98 list, ) costs $100 more than the CQ62-225nr and offers the same Athlon II P320 processor, but it, too, enjoyed a 12-percent edge on PCMark Vantage, thanks in large part to its extra 1GB of memory. I saw a similar spread on Cinebench R10 between the Dell iM501R-13230BK and the CQ62-225nr, with the CQ62-225nr trailing the Dell iM501R-13230BK by 14 percent on Cinebench R10. The Dell iM501R-13230BK also completed our Photoshop CS4 test in 6 less seconds, for an 11-percent advantage over the CQ62-225nr. The scores were tighter on our Windows Media Encoder test, where only 3 seconds separated their scores. The CQ62-225nr's integrated ATI Radeon HD 4250 graphics can give you HD video playback, but will not allow for 3D gaming. You'll struggle with anything more taxing than World of Warcraft. The Compaq CQ62 uses a 6-cell (47Whr) and ran for 3 hours 34 minutes on our MobileMark 2007 battery-drain test, putting it right in range with laptops that use mainstream Intel or AMD processors. The <p>Compaq Presario CQ62-225nr</> is not without its faults. A Webcam and a media card reader are offered on nearly every laptop sold right now, their absence on even an entry-level model is disappointing, but given the low price, these aren't deal-breakers. The slightly squeaky keys may annoy after a time as well. If you can get past those flaws, the Compaq CQ62-225nr may win you over with its affordable price, pleasing design, quiet operation, respectable performance, and decent battery life.
