The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 260</> (starts at $989.10; $1,499 as tested) is a business-oriented convertible-hybrid laptop, the latest iteration of Lenovo's excellent line of business ultraportables that can double as tablets. In many ways, the ThinkPad Yoga 260 is a refinement of the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</>, which it replaces. While keeping the ThinkPad Yoga 12's slim dimensions, Lenovo has upgraded the processor, graphics card, and battery, so the ThinkPad Yoga 260 performed very well on our benchmark tests, and outlasted most of the competition on our battery life test. Add to that 4G/LTE support and a lightweight carbon fiber design with an integrated stylus, and the ThinkPad Yoga 260 earns our Editors' Choice for business convertible-hybrid laptops. Design and Features The ThinkPad Yoga 260 deftly combines the business features of Lenovo's ThinkPad line with the hinge and flexibility of its Yoga line. It has four screen modes: Laptop, Stand, Tablet, and Tent. Tablet mode has the keyboard folded all the way behind the screen, while Tent mode has the system propped on its edges, with the display facing out, and Stand mode has the keyboard face down, with the screen pointing out. The ThinkPad Yoga 260 is lightweight, but feels very durable. It's similar in overall design to the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</>, but has more angular edges. It measures 0.7 by 12.2 by 8.7 (HWD) and weighs in at 2.93 pounds. The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> is identical in size, but is a little heavier at 3.5 pounds, likely because the ThinkPad Yoga 260 is made of carbon fiber rather than aluminum and magnesium. The ThinkPad Yoga 260 is even lighter than the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch (2015)</>, which weighs 3.02 pounds. Our review unit shipped with a 12.5-inch, full HD (1,920-by-1,080-resolution) display (a configuration with a 1,366-by-768-resolution screen is also available for $200 less). The vibrant In-Plane Switching (IPS) touch screen is protected by Gorilla Glass and is very responsive to touch gesturesâ€”swiping through apps on the left side of the display worked seamlessly in testing. The panel also supports the bundled wirelss stylus that is stored on the right side of the laptop, which is also where it quickly charges. The stylus works smoothly on the touch screen, but it isn't pressure sensitive. While it's good for annotating webpages in Microsoft Edge or PDF files, it's not suited for art or design tasks. On the right side of the laptop, you'll find a Kensington lock port, a headphone jack, a microSD card reader, a micro-SIM card slot, a mini-HDMI port, and a USB 3.0 port. On the left side is a mini DisplayPort, a OneLink port, a Smart Card reader, and another USB 3.0 port, along with the Power jack. The ThinkPad Yoga 260 comes with dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 for wireless connectivity, along with 4G/LTE support, although you will need a contract from AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, or T-Mobile to use the latter. The full-size AccuType keyboard has flat keys that slope slightly inward and is a breeze to type on. A pointing stick sits right under the "G" and "H" keys, and the touchpad is a clickable surface with dedicated right, left, and center scroll buttons right above it. Our Yoga 260 packs a 256GB PCIe solid-state drive (SSD), and runs 64-bit Windows 10 OS. It's also available with a 128GB or 512GB SSD. That's a small storage upgrade from the 180GB drive in the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> we tested. Security features include Trusted Platform Module (TPM) encryption and a fingerprint reader right below the keyboard. Lenovo offers a one-year limited warranty on the system. Performance The ThinkPad Yoga 260 uses a latest-gen 2.8GHz Intel Core i5-6200U, and 8GB of RAM, which helped the system handily beat almost all of the competition in testing. On the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, which measures productivity performance, the ThinkPad Yoga 260 scored 3,178, better than the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> (2,923) and the <p>Dell Latitude 14 7000 Series (E7450)</> (2,681), both of which use fifth-generation Intel Core i5 processors. It also outscored the <p>HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 (G4U67UT) </>(2,775), with a fourth-generation Core i5 chip, and the <p>Dell Latitude 13 7000 Series 2-in-1 (7350)</> (2,426), which comes with an Intel Core M processor. See How We Test Laptops With its integrated Intel HD Graphics 520, the ThinkPad Yoga 260 bested or matched the competition in the 3D graphics tests. It scored 5,313 in 3DMark Cloud Gate and 340 in Fire Strike Extreme. In contrast, the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> scored a lower 5,291 in Cloud Gate, and an identical 340 in Fire Strike Extreme. The laptop also beat out the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch </>(4,915 in Cloud Gate; 309 in Fire Strike Extreme) and the Dell Latitude 14 E7450 (4,396 in Cloud Gate; 281 in Fire Strike Extreme). Although it did not outperform any system by a wide margin, the ThinkPad Yoga 260 is capable of better graphics rendering than many other business ultraportables and convertible hybrids. Multimedia performance is another of the ThinkPad Yoga 260's strong suits. It scored a best-in-class 2 minutes 30 seconds in the Handbrake video-encoding test. That's a better time than the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> (2:44) and the HP 1040 G1 (4:00). The ThinkPad Yoga 260 didn't fare as well on the Photoshop CS6 test, at 5:05. Both the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> (4:12) and the Lenovo X1 Carbon Touch (4:14) scored slightly better. The ThinkPad Yoga 260 also outlasts the competition. In our battery rundown test, the laptop lasted 10 hours 11 minutes on a single charge. The only comparable laptop that beats it (and barely, at that) is the Dell Latitude 14 E7450 (10:12). Both the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</> (7:26) and the <p>Dell Latitude 13</> 7000 Series 2-in-1 (9:51) pale in comparison. Conclusions The <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 260</> offers many improvements over the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 12</>, including a full-size HDMI port, 4G/LTE capability, better battery life, and improved performance with the sixth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, all for $100 less. It's a solidly built, lightweight system with good security features, a stylus, and a responsive touch screen. As such, it's our Editors' Choice for business-oriented convertible-hybrid laptops.
