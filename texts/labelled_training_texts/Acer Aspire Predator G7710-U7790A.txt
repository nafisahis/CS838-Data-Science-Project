A newer, fiercer Predator is on the prowl. The <p>Acer Aspire Predator G7710-U7790A</> ($2,299 list) looks just like its predecessor, the G7700-UQ9550A, but it's now a lot more capable on the game grid. It's still bright orange, and you'll still either love it or hate it, but it does make the statement that you're serious about PC gaming. It's a system that can grow with you: It can already play today's games, and down the line you'll be able to update it to help handle the increased requirements sure to accompany the games of tomorrow. The Predator is a good choice for gaming, with a reasonable price tag, a flashy chassis, and the power to back up the promise of its styling. The Predator can't be mistaken for a business or multimedia PC. The bright orange chassis with its swinging front panel says gaming all the way. It's a full-size tower, with a whole lot of expansion space inside. First, there are the easily accessible drive bays (one occupied) that can hold up to four hard drives set up in a RAID array. A single 1TB drive came with the G7710-U7790A, but you can set the remaining three bays up as a RAID 5 array for data redundancy and speed. When you're not fiddling with them, the drives are hidden behind an illuminated door. You need to disassemble the system's arms to get to the rest of the system's innards, but once inside, you can see the empty slots for up to three more PCIe x16 cards, three more memory DIMMs, a PCIe x1 card, and plenty of space to move around in. The system comes with a PCI 56K modem; people with broadband can remove it to install any other PCI card. The G7710-U7790A configuration I received had a single Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 card, and you can add another for dual-card in an SLI configuration. The system can support up to two GTX 280 cards for dual SLI or up to three GeForce 9800GTX+ cards for triple SLI. The motherboard will also support ATI Radeon 4870 X2, 4870, or 4850 cards for CrossFireX multi-card configurations. (For most of those options you'll have to supply your own cards, as the only other configuration of the G7710 that Acer offers comes with 4870 X2 graphics, which combines two 4870 GPUs on the same card.) This is a very flexible solution if you're the type who upgrades graphics cards often during the life of your gaming PCs. The system's 750W power supply can keep even multicard setups running smoothly. Like all Acer systems, the Aspire Predator comes with a somewhat bloated software build. Office trial? Check. Puny 60-day McAfee subscription? Check. eSobi? Check. I'd love to get a retail system that doesn't have any of these extras on it. (Hey, a guy can dream, can't he?) The G7710-U7790A comes with an Intel Core i7-940 processor, a vast improvement over the Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 processor that the G7700-UQ9550A had. Like all Core i7 processors, the i7-940 can "turbo boost" one or two of its cores in case it needs more performance for a short period of timeespecially helpful for single-threaded applications like games. This strategy bore fruit in the benchmark test numbers we got for the G7710-U7790A. The system is capable of playing three of our four gaming tests smoothly: Crysis at 1,280-by-1,024 (74 frames per second), World in Conflict (WiC) at 1,280-by-1,024 (84 fps), and WiC at 1,920-by-1,200 (35 fps). Ideally the Crysis scores should be above 60 fps and the WiC scores above 30 fps to get an enjoyable gaming experience with minimal dropped frames. Only the Crysis test at 1,920-by-1,200 didn't break the threshold (17 fps). So far, the only systems to break 60 fps on the most strenuous Crysis test have been $5K+ triple-SLI systems with overclocked processors, so the G7710-U7790A is a relative bargain. The Core i7 processor also helps the Predator chew up and spit out multimedia test numbers. The system finished the Windows Media Encoder test in a quick 32 seconds, and the Photoshop CS4 test in only 1:07. Core 2 Quad systems are fast, but Core i7 systems are faster. In fact, these numbers almost match those of the <p>Apple Mac Pro (Quad-Core)</>, which we recently tested with a Nehalem-based Xeon processor (the "professional-grade" version of the Core i7). The Predator also does well on PCMark Vantage and 3DMark Vantage tests. On PCMark Vantage, which measures a system's day-to-day performance, the Predator's 6,884 point score is among the highest I've seen in a non-overclocked system. The Predator's 29,475 (Entry) and 4,188 (Extreme) 3D performance scores in 3DMark Vantage are also quite good for a reasonably priced system. One glance at its sculpted exterior reveals that the <p>Acer Aspire Predator G7710-U7790A</> is a gaming box. Let's get one argument out of the way: Even with gaming laptops becoming ever more powerful, none can touch this system's gaming performance, particularly at this price. Our gaming laptops are tested at a more forgiving 1,024- by-768 resolution on the gaming tests, and they can't approach the frame rates the Predator gets at 1,280-by-1,024. Performance-wise, it stacks up well against other gaming desktops, at least those well below the "$5K club." The G7710-U7790A holds its own against the Dell XPS 435, which is cheaper by around $500and the Predator has more of the expansion and tinkering space the gamer craves. Amazingly, the G7710-U7790A is similar in Windows performance to the <p>Apple Mac Pro (Quad-Core)</>, which costs about $1,500 more. Both have similarly clocked quad-core processors, though the Predator has the edge in 3D graphics cards. The <p>HP Firebird with VoodooDNA 803</> is a lust object and is relatively eco-friendly for a gaming desktop. It's also about the same price as the Predator, at $2,100 list. The Predator is a better gaming system overall, however, both in performance and in internal expansion space. Our "cheap" gaming Editors' Choice, the <p>Gateway FX6800-01e</> is a little long in the tooth, but it remains on top because it offers most of the performance of the G7710-U7790A but at a much more palatable $1,250 price tag. The FX6800 is expandable, but the Predator is much more so. The FX6800 is a lot cheaper feeling than the Predator, but the extra grand in your pocket will be welcome in this economy. Overall, the <p>Acer Aspire Predator G7710-U7790A</> is a very good buy for $2,299. It will play today's games at a selection of resolutions, so you don't have to sacrifice too much detail (if any) for a bigger picture. It's expandable with a capital E. So if you're the type who buys a good system, then gradually builds it up to become an excellent system, take a look at the Acer Predator. It's a much better buy than last year's model, and has better infrastructure for future expansion. Check out the <p>Acer Aspire Predator G7710-U7790A</>'s performance test results.
