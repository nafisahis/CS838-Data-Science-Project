The <p>Asus Essentio CG8350-06</> ($899.99 list at Best Buy) desktop PC shows promise: It's a large desktop for not a lot of money with a good foundation for gaming. It has a second-generation Intel Core i-processor (aka, Sandy Bridge), 8GB of memory, a speedy 1TB hard drive, and a motherboard that supports dual-graphics cards for 3D gaming, so at first glance, it looks like this desktop would be perfect for the gamer that wants to make his own choice of graphics cards instead of having to settle for what comes with the system in retail. Unfortunately, the desktop has a major flaw that makes it unsuitable for gaming out of the box. You'll have to upgrade the power supplya major undertakingif you want to support anything more powerful than a single mid-range graphics card, effectively erasing the benefits of the dual-slot motherboard. Rewiring a desktop is much more complicated than simply adding a pair of 3D graphics cards. Anyone expecting an easy-to-upgrade desktop as a base for their gaming rig will be sorely disappointed. Design and Features The CG8350-06 is a fairly large tower desktop PC. As such, the desktop has plenty of interior room, including spots for two more internal hard drives, another optical drive, and 3 SATA ports (one of which is 6Gbps) for the internal drives. There are two CrossFireX-compatible PCIe x16 slots and two PCI slots on the Asus motherboard. (CrossFireX is ATI/AMD shorthand for linking two or more graphics cards together on the motherboard in order to get better 3D performance or support for multiple monitors.) It's notable that the PCIe slots are both physically x16, but only one is electrically x16 (the other is x4). That means you won't get the full bandwidth from the second graphics card slot, however unless you like to run 3D games at very high quality levels on a 30-inch panel with 2,560 by 1,600 resolution, you're not likely to notice the difference between a x16/x4 and a x16/x16 graphics card setup. One of the positives of the CrossFireX setup is it will support at least four monitors simultaneously with two graphics cards, regardless of the x16/x4 setup. Sadly, the included 400W power supply (PSU) isn't suited to running even a single AMD Radeon HD 6990 graphics card (AMD's current top-end card: AMD recommends at least a 750W PSU for one 6990 card and 1,000-1,200W for two); you'll have to pick something more pedestrian, like an ATI Radeon HD 5570 graphics card for your system. There's only one 6-pin supplementary power cable for graphics cards on the PSU, so the Radeon HD 6990 wouldn't work in this system anyway. Adding a graphics card or two is easy, but rewiring your PC with a new power supply is fairly involved. You'll have to rewire the entire desktop: graphics cards, motherboard leads, hard drives, and optical drives. Some of the wiring snakes through the chassis, complicating what would have been a 10-minute graphics card upgrade session. This desktop would have scored better if Asus had included at least a 750W PSU with support for high-end graphics cards, or even better, a 1000W PSU. The CG8350-06 has several exterior ports to hook up all your digital toys, including iPhones, iPads, and Droid phones. There are a total of 10 USB ports scattered around the system: 8 are USB 2.0, while the last two in the back are faster USB 3.0 ports. The CG8350-06 has an HDMI port in addition to the usual VGA and DVI ports in the back for video output. There's also a multimedia card reader. Notably absent are FireWire and eSATA ports, which help provide faster video and photo file transfers in external hard drives. Also missing is a Blu-ray player. The system's DVD burner is adequate, but I'd like to see Blu-ray on all mid range and high-end systems with HDMI ports. We've seen Blu-ray drives on desktops like the <p>Dell Inspiron Zino HD (Inspiron 410)</> ($849.99 direct, 4 stars) and <p>HP Pavilion Elite HPE-410y</> ($929.99 list, 3 stars), but I'd like to see Blu-ray on any HDMI-equipped system over $750-800. There is a Best Buy app installed, which lets you shop for and buy applications online. Between that and the fully functional Office 2010 Starter app, you should be fine out of the box. Both let you buy more online, but only if you choose to do so. This situation is better than the bloatware found on desktops like the <p>HP Pavilion p6751c-b</> ($749.99 list, 3.5 stars), which pile unwanted trialware on the system before you even take it out of the box. Performance Performance-size, the CG8350-06 was actually great on our multimedia benchmark tests. The combination of 8GB of memory and an Intel Core i7-2600 processor helped it score a very quick 1 minute 34 seconds on our Handbrake video encoder test and 2:57 on the Photoshop CS5 test. To put that into perspective, that's faster than the overclocked V3 Gaming Move 3DS ($1,199 direct, 4 stars), a compact gaming system we recently reviewed. But the CG8350-06 was no match for the Move 3DS on our 3D game tests. The Move 3DS achieved playable scores on Crysis and Lost Planet 2 game tests, while the CG8350-06 scored a low 14 frames per second (fps) on Crysis DirectX 10 (Medium quality) and wasn't able to complete the Lost Planet 2 tests at all due to DirectX 11 incompatibility. This shows that at least on first flush, the system has a good foundation for gaming (thanks to the Sandy Bridge processor and 8GB of memory), but the system needs a decent graphics card or two to build it into a raging gaming PC. This CG8350-06 had the potential to be the ultimate tweakable gaming rig that you could buy from a retailer (as opposed to commissioning one from a gaming PC builder like Alienware or Origin PC). The desktop is predicated on giving you a strong base CPU and memory so you can add your choice of graphics cards later. What choosy gamer wouldn't want that? The system even has customizable BIOS settings in the setup screen for changing CPU clock speeds and the like. The CG8350-06 comes with a "gaming" mouse and keyboard, but the system really isn't suited for gaming out of the box. Best Buy's Website offers gaming controllers, joysticks, mice, speakers, and headsets as recommended accessories, so they're courting the gaming crowd. But here's the rub: Sure, you can add up to two graphics cards in the CG8350-06 later, but you'll also need to upgrade the system's 400W power supply if you want anything more powerful than a single ATI Radeon HD 5570 card, never mind two. The desktop's built-in Intel HD Graphics 2000 GPU is adequate for HD Video and light gaming, but you really need more power if you want to run higher-end games like Crysis, Lost Planet 2, and (possibly) the upcoming Duke Nukem Forever. If you want to work on photos and videos, the CG8350-06 is a PC you want on your desk, but if you want to play 3D games, you'll need to budget at least $200-$600 for graphics and/or power upgrades. I would like to recommend the CG8350-06 to novice to moderate-level gamers and enthusiastsI really do. It has a decent, easily upgradable motherboard: Adding a PCIe graphics cards are one of the easier upgrades out there after memory and a hard drive. But to fully take advantage of this system, you'll have to upgrade the power supply as well, which is a huge pain in the ass. If you're into gaming, I'd recommend the V3 Gaming Move 3DS for compact gaming rigs, and our current entry-level gaming Editors' choice, the <p>Cyberpower Gamer Dragon</> ($1,099 direct, 4.5 stars) or the <p>iBuypower LAN Warrior II</> ($999 direct, 3.0 stars) if you want an inexpensive, but expandable gaming desktop.
