These days, business laptops have to meet a wide variety of needs. Professionals require a machine that provides computing power, networking options, connections galore, and hours of battery life. The <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> ($1,199.99 street) fills most of these needs, but if battery life is a major concern, then this laptop is going to disappoint. Design Though quite a few manufacturers, including Asus, have brought some great looking business laptops to market, like the <p>Dell Vostro 3300</> ($910 street, 3.5 stars), most laptops, like the <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T410s</> ($1,504 direct, 4 stars), tend to stick to the basics. The <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> keeps a conservative look, but puts a fashionable twist on it that turns basic black into something more black tie. The frame around the screen and the base of the chassis is matte plastic, but the lid and palm rest get a stylish and protective aluminum casing that resists scratches and won't attract fingerprints. The 14-inch widescreen offers a 1366 by 768 resolution for 720p video viewing, and is topped with a 2-megapixel webcam that has a built-in lens cover. It weighs a hefty 5.46 pounds The full-sized keyboard eschews the chiclet-style design that is so popular in consumer laptops, opting instead for a more traditional design. The keyboard is also spill resistant, so you can now have lunch at your desk without the fear that a spilled drink will destroy your work computer. The touchpad is comfortably smooth and supports multi-touch, bringing two-fingered scrolling and zooming to your work machine. Features Connectivity is one of the most important aspects of any business laptop, and the <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> offers a variety of ports. There are three USB 2.0 ports (including one combination USB/eSATA port), optical drive, and jacks for both telephone and Ethernet. Connecting to an external display is also easier thanks to the VGA, HDMI, and DisplayPort connections. ATI Eyefinity also allows connection of up to two additional monitors, providing significantly more visual real estate. Security options abound, as the B43J-A1b comes with several built-in layers of protection. A fingerprint scanner provides biometric-based security. A Smart Card reader allows the use of security card-based user authentication. Intel vPro provides remote IT access and automatic disabling of lost or stolen laptops. Our test unit had 4GB of DDR3 memory. The 320GB 7,200 rpm hard drive will likely offer plenty of storage space on its own, but users will still want to take advantage of the USB/eSATA port when connecting an external hard drive. The B43J-A1B also has an ExpressCard 34 expansion slot for further flexibility. Docking station support allows quick connection to peripherals, power, and communication devices, but will require purchasing a docking station separately. For fast access to the Web, the <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> features the same ExpressGate instant-on environment that has been used in several other Asus models this year, like the <p>Asus U52F-BBL9</> ($749 list, 4 stars). A dedicated ExpressGate power button allows you to enter ExpressGate from a powered-down state, skipping lengthy Windows boot times to provide instant web access. Performance Though the B43J-A1B is equipped with a 2.66GHz Intel Core i5-560M processor, it only scored 6,310 points in our PCMark Vantage benchmark test, a score which falls behind competitors in the same business space. By comparison, the Lenovo T410 scored 7,315 with the slightly lower0powered Core i5-540M, and the <p>Dell Vostro 3300</> scored 6,714. While the <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> is still a competent machine that will handle the demands of professional computing, better performance is available for a similar price. It completed the HandBrake video encoding test in 2 minutes 36 seconds, and plowed through our Photoshop benchmark in 4:28. While those scores won't satisfy graphic designers or video editors, they are more than good enough for the regular business professional. The B43J-A1B performed better when tested in graphics processing, earning scores as good or better than competing laptops. It scored a respectable 4,797 at low settings, and 3,345 at native resolution in our 3DMark06 test, compared with the Lenovo T410, which scored a lower 4,178 and 3,067, respectively. The B43J-A1B's success in the 3D test is partly due to its discrete ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 graphics chipset. The B43J-A1B completed our gaming tests with reasonable, but unplayable scores. At medium settings, Crysis ran at 28.6 fps, and Lost Planet 2 produced 19 fps, meaning that the games will run, but won't provide playable frame rates. They did even more poorly when tested at high resolutions, eking out unplayable scores of 6 fps in Crysis and 9 fps in Lost Planet 2. Despite the Core i5 processor and discrete graphics, this laptop just doesn't have the chops for high-end gaming, but it wasn't meant to. The <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> comes with ATI Stream, AMD's automatic switching technology, that enables the laptop to change between the ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 chipset for 3D-taxing tasks and Intel GMA HD (Core i5) integrated graphics for lower-end office tasks. Additionally, Asus' power management utility reduces power requirements by automatically switching to Intel integrated graphics when drawing power from the battery. While there's plenty to love about this laptop, its 48WH battery couldn't squeeze out enough life to last through a cross-country flightÂ—or even until lunchtime. On MobileMark 2007, the B43J-A1B only lasted 2 hours 20 minutes. While battery life won't be an issue while sitting stationary at a desk, plugged into a wall outlet or docking station, it means you certainly won't get you through a cross country flight, and might struggle to make it through a working lunch. The <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> offers a strong collection of features and hardware, but falls short in performance and flat on battery life. The result is a laptop that most will find adequate, but some will find frustrating. The Editors' Choice <p>Lenovo ThinkPad T410</> offers a similar feature set and better battery life for only a bit more. So long as you don't stray from wall power for more than a couple hours, the <p>Asus B43J-A1B</> should offer everything you need.
