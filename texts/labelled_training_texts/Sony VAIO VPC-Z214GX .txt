The latest in the Sony Z Series of laptops혰the <p>Sony VAIO VPC-Z214GX </>($2,499.99 list with dock and battery slice)혰is as thin as the <p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch</> ($1,299 direct, 4 stars) and many times more powerful. It comes with a high-end docking station that provides a ton of features and an extended battery slice. While the "Light Peak" Power Media Dock, which includes a Blu-ray drive, AMD discrete graphics, and host of connectivity ports, is innovative, it's a desktop fixture and not meant to be carted around. The laptop provides an unprecedented 15 hours of battery life, but does so with the extended battery slice (which is part of the bundle) added to the laptop, yet another external component that tacks on weight. The loud fan noises (during resource-intensive tasks) and below-par typing experience hold this laptop back. Flat-out Thin The Z214GX rivals the <p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch</> and Samsung Series 9 ($1,650 list, 4 stars) in terms of thinness. Its carbon fiber (exterior) and aluminum (interior) frame measures a scant 0.56 inches thick, which is slightly thinner than the Samsung Series 9 (0.62 to 0.64 inches thick) and Apple Air 13-inch (0.76 inches at its thickest). The Apple Air 13-inch, however, has a tapered design and a much thinner front bezel (0.11 inches). At 2.5 pounds, the Z214GX is the lightest 13-inch ultraportable and one of the thinnest if you exclude the second battery. Unlike many of its competitors, the Z214GX also includes an extended 49WH battery slice that snaps over the standard one and spans the base of the laptop. With its battery slice attached the laptop weighs 4.3 pounds, which is as heavy as a 14-inch laptop, like the 4.4-pound <p>HP Pavilion dm4-1265dx</> ($649.99 list, 4 stars). With a 1,600-by-900 resolution, the Z214GX's 13.1-inch widescreen is the most impressive in its class. Although the Apple Air 13-inch has a resolution of 1,440-by-900, every other 13-inch ultraportable혰and let's throw in the <p>Toshiba Portege R835-P50X</> ($850 list, 4 stars) and <p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1</> ($1,399 direct, 3.5 stars) here혰have screens of 1,366-by-768. The island-style keys on the keyboard are almost flush with their foundation and lack the depth I'm accustomed to. You'll find a more responsive keyboard on the Lenovo X1 and Toshiba R835-P50X. The Z214GX uses a clickpad, which integrates the mouse buttons, like the Apple Air and Samsung Series 9. Unfortunately, it's half the size of the clickpads on the other two and my least favorite feature on this laptop. Every mouse click requires an inordinate amount of pressure, which can be wearisome on the finger you use to click with after an hour of Web surfing. Despite its cracker-thin profile, Sony included ports that aren't available on the Apple Air 13-inch and Samsung Series 9, including VGA, a USB 3.0 port, and full size Ethernet port. It also has a USB 2.0 (with sleep-and-charge functionality) and HDMI (you can use the second HDMI port on the dock for a dual-monitor setup and add both VGA ports for a four-monitor setup). Like most Sony laptops, separate SD and Memory Stick slots are located in the front bezel. The speakers are horridly weak, lacking any kind of bass and overall volume. You'll get a better sounding pair from the Leonvo X1 or Samsung Series 9. Unlike its predecessor, the <p>Sony VAIO VPC-Z1390X</> ($3,800 direct, 4 stars), the Z214GX doesn't support dual SSDs and 3G modems. The Light Peak Docking Station The Power Media Dock bundled with the Z214GX is unique. It basically took all the features that Sony left out of the Z214GX and put them into an external box that measures 5.6 by 8.7 by 0.65 inches (HWD). The Power Media Dock features a Blu-ray drive and discrete graphics card, as well as two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0, HDMI, VGA, and Ethernet ports. It connects to the laptop via a proprietary cable, which plugs simultaneously into both the USB 3.0 port and the AC port right next to it on the laptop. The traditional AC adapter plugs into the Power Media Dock. The Dock uses Intel's Light Peak technology, which has more than 20 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0, and the connector provides the speed necessary to run the components and ports on the dock as if they were built into the laptop. In geek-speak, it's taking PCI-Express out of the box. When not attached to the Power Media Dock, the AC port on the laptop connects to the traditional AC plug, while the USB port reverts back to USB 3.0 (which is 10 times the speed of USB 2.0). I would have liked for the Dock to include a hard drive, since the laptop's 128GB SSD drive will only get you so far. And, frankly, the dock can be a hassle to take on the road. Wicked Fast, But Poor Ventilation Performance enthusiasts will appreciate the sheer power of the Z214GX's standard-voltage 2.7-Intel Core i7-2620M processor. But there are two good reasons why the Samsung Series 9 and <p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch</> opted for low-voltage CPUs instead. The first is heat, which, depending on the task, could send the base of the laptop soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, as measured with a Fluke thermometer. The second battery acts as a buffer and is almost a must in this case. The Toshiba R835-P50X and Lenovo X1 also run on standard-voltage processors, but their thicker frames and better heat distribution are more equipped to accommodate them. You also have to contend with fan noise that kicks in during moderately intensive tasks. Granted, it's pretty quiet while playing a Blu-ray movie, surfing the Web, or editing a Word document. But if you're transcoding a video, rendering a huge photo, or playing any 3D-intensive game, the Z214GX will sound pretty loud. The Z214GX pulverized the Air 13-inch and Series 9 in all our benchmark tests, except for the gaming tests. The Z214GX received top marks in Handbrake (1 minute 40 seconds), Photoshop CS5 (3:39), and Cinebench R11.5 (3:06), and, with its SSD, it produced one of the highest PCMark 7 (3,328) scores thus far. Quite simply, it's the fastest ultraportable we have tested in PC Labs. Sony also wanted the Z214GX to have the same 3D prowess as the Sony Z1390X and was betting that the AMD Radeon 6650M in the Power Media Dock would help the laptop to that end. While powerful on paper, the 6650M didn't live up to expectations and wasn't nearly as impressive as the Nvidia GeForce GT 330M in the Sony Z1390X. Its 3DMark 06 (5,206) and Crysis (24.2 frames per second) scores were only about 10% percent better than that of the integrated graphics built into the Z214GX's Core i7 processor. I suspect that Sony might have dialed down speeds of the 6650M on purpose so that it didn't overpower the laptop. If I had to pick something to make up for all the Z214GX's weaknesses, it would be in its battery life. The standard 45WH battery is latch-less, but you use a coin to remove eight screws and swap it out. With the standard battery alone, the Z214GX lasted 6 hours 30 minutes in MobileMark 2007 tests. When adding the extended battery, the laptop cranked out 15:32, doubling, even tripling the times of the Apple Air 13-inch (5:35), Samsung Series 9 (6:04), Toshiba R835-P50X (9:26), and Sony VPC-Z1390X (5:19). The Lenovo X1 has a similar battery combo, but at 6:40, didn't last nearly as long as the Z214GX. The <p>Sony VAIO VPC-Z214GX </>is one of the thinnest ultraportables ever made, with amazing battery life using the two batteries. The compromises that other ultraportables made to get their sleek profiles, Sony ingeniously stuffed in an external box powered by Intel's Light Peak technology. While including cutting-edge features and powerful components into a sleek chassis, Sony still managed to overlook some fundamentals of good laptop design. The high heat, fan noise, underwhelming keyboard, mouse click experience, and poor speakers are far too many drawbacks for this kind of money. You're better off with the <p>Toshiba Portege R835-P50X</>.
