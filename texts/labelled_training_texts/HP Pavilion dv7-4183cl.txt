Anytime a company updates a laptop with faster parts, without jacking up the price, it should be given its due recognition. It has been several months since the <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4083cl</> ($999 list, 4 stars) was named the Editors' Choice in the desktop replacement category, and already HP has named a successor. Its replacement, the Pavilion dv7-4183cl ($999.99 list), a Costco laptop, is even better--you could even say one of the best. Its plethora of features and gorgeous metallic design are carried over from the previous version. And the new components, including a faster Core i5 processor, 6GB of DDR3 memory (from 4GB), and bigger battery, are more dominant than anything else you can buy at this price. For this reason, the dv-4183cl takes over as the Editors' Choice for the desktop replacement category. Design The entire line of HP Pavilion laptops has abandoned shiny plastic for an aluminum chassis, particularly on the lid and throughout the interior. It's complemented by HP's imprinting technology, made up of laser-etched decorative. Metal is already the craze in industrial design, pioneered by the likes of Apple and Asus, and now HP is heading full steam ahead in that right direction. But that's not saying plastic isn't desirable. The <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> ($729.99 list, 4 stars) and <p>Dell Inspiron 17R-2950MRB</> ($950 list, 4 stars) effectively wed motifs and colors to liven the design of their plastic chassis. At 7 pounds, the dv7-4183cl is thinner, but not lighter than the Dell 17R-2950MRB (6.7 lbs). It's a beast compared to the R580-JBB2 (5.4 lbs) and Acer Aspire AS5820T-5951 ($723 street, 4 stars) (5.2lbs), in large part because of its screen size and big 93WH battery. The extended battery elevates it about an inch from the back. Otherwise, its dimensions (16.5 by 11 by 1-inches) are as slim as the <p>Apple MacBook Pro 17-inch</> ($2,799 direct, 4 stars) (15.5 by 10.5 by 0.98 inches). A 17.3-inch widescreen is enormous for a laptop. It's why you want a desktop replacement in the first place. The screen is two sizes bigger than that of the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> and Acer AS5820T-5951, and its 1,600 by 900 resolution is higher, too (the other two top out at 1,366 by 768). A good typing experience is also a must: The typing experience on the chiclet-style keyboard deserves as much merit as that of the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> and Dell 17R-2950MRB. Adjacent to the keyboard is a full-size numeric keypad, as opposed to the undersized one found in the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</>. HP tried to mimic Apple's all-in-one click touchpad, though with little success. Depending on how you surf the Web, the touchpad can be frustrating at times. A single finger is the best way to surf, and tapping anywhere on the touchpad to induce a click is probably the best way to do it. Turning off the multitouch gestures is yet another solution, which can be done in the Synaptics tab, located in the Mouse settings, in the Control Panel. You should also be on the lookout for driver updates, which fixes some of the touchpad issues. Features A Blu-ray drive is the latest craze in desktop replacement laptops, and pricey, too. But HP and Costco managed to throw one in at this price, so now you can watch the latest Blu-ray titles on the 17-inch screen. Well, that, or stream them to an HDTV using the included HDMI port. Almost every desktop replacement comes with an HDMI port, but not necessarily a Blu-ray drive. The dv7's two-speaker and subwoofer system are enhanced further by the included Beats audio software. There are 4 USB ports divided equally between both sides, one of which (on the left) doubles as an eSATA port. Lastly, a fast 500GB (7,200rpm) hard drive is the icing on the cake, as faster transfer rates translate into better performance. Since this is a Costco configuration, this well-known retailer offers its customers some added benefits. Whereas most vendors provide just a one-year warranty, Costco bumps that up to two years. It also offers Costco's Concierge Services, a free service to Costco members who purchase electronics at the store. The service gives you access to technicians who can walk you system setup and troubleshoot any problems. Lastly, the store accepts returns within 90 days (which takes care of buyers' remorse). Performance Since the last iteration, the processor has been bumped up from a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-450M to a 2.53GHz Core i5-460M. The dv7-4183cl's upped the memory to 6GB, matching the Dell 17R-2950MRB's specs in terms of these two components. It's a much faster combination than that of the Acer AS5820T-5951 and <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</>. This same combination is the reason why it and the Dell 17R were equally matched in Handbrake (2:49), Photoshop CS5 (4:56), and Cinebench R11.5 (2.23) tests. It took top honors in PCMark Vantage (6,428), thanks to a third component that this test takes advantage of혰graphics. Gaming prowess is a hallmark of any good desktop replacement. This is where the dv7-4183cl and Dell 17R-2950MRB part ways. The dv7-4183cl uses an ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 graphics chip, which is far better than the integrated Intel solutions found in the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</>, Acer AS5820T-5951, and Dell 17R-2950MRB. It's a midrange gaming card, though, so it won't obliterate frame rates like the graphics cards found in true gaming laptops. But you won't see a single frame dropped in games like Crysis (28.2 frames per second) and Lost Planet 2 (18.6 fps). Its 3DMark06 score (4,722) was at least twice that of laptops that use integrated graphics only. The dv7-4183cl also has something that the <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</>, Dell 17R-2950MRB, and Acer AS5820T-5951 don't혰a manual switchable graphics system. (To access the switching solution, you right click on the desktop screen to see an option to "Configure Switchable Graphics.") The benefit of using a dual-graphics environment is that you can reap the benefits of an Intel integrated chipset혰purely there for energy savings혰when the tasks being performed aren't 3D-intensive (or not playing HD videos, hardcore games, and running CAD software). ATI includes a software configuration tool that will let you manually switch between graphics. The laptop also defaults to the Intel graphics when the laptop is unplugged from the AC adapter. Desktop replacement laptops are generally not known for their battery endurance, but the dv7-4083cl is a notable exception. The previous version came with an 87WH battery (9-cell), which is already impressive at the time. This time, the dv7-4183cl upped the battery capacity to 93WH, which bumped up its MobileMark 2007 score to 6 hours flat (the previous version lasted 4 hours 45 minutes). Six hours of battery life is better than the Dell 17R-2950MRB (4:09) and <p>Samsung R580-JBB2</> (3:33). The Acer AS5820T-5951 scored over 7 hours (7:37) in MobileMark tests, but isn't nearly as powerful as the dv7-4183cl. A powerful desktop replacement laptop with great battery life is a rare find. Following it up with a more powerful and battery efficient successor is even rarer. The <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4183cl</> is tops in its class, because it's willing to take performance to the next level without jacking up the price. It's still the best desktop replacement for at home or when you're on the road. Compare the <p>HP Pavilion dv7-4183cl</> with several other laptops side by side.
