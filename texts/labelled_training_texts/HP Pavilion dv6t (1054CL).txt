The <p>HP Pavilion dv6t (1054CL)</> ($950 street) is an all-purpose media-center laptop that can meet the demands of a big family or college student and sate the performance hunger of a video editor or a part-time gamer. In addition to having a gorgeous, 16-inch widescreen, a huge 500GB hard drive, and a midrange ATI graphics card, this build is available at Costco for under $1,000. You'll have to uninstall some junk software, though, so you can spend less time watching the rotating hourglass and more time with your digital hobbies. Even if the dv6t is a budget laptop, it certainly doesn't look like one. The great thing about HP's Pavilion line is that from the outside you can't tell a $1,500 laptop from a $700 one. The dv6t is decked out in a glossy finish, and depending on the configuration, one of HP's many signature imprints is laminated under the shiny coat. This configuration features a wave pattern with what looks like crop circles beneath it. The imprints seem to ooze into the dark chrome interior, clustering on the palm rests. And though that region has a tendency to pick up fingerprints and smudges, the system comes with a little piece of cloth that will easily wipe them away. I think the decor is more attractive than the <p>Gateway MC7803u</>'s and the Acer Aspire 6930G's. The dv6t's 6.1-pound chassis is not the lightest among 16-inch laptopsthe <p>Lenovo IdeaPad Y650</> is thinner and weighs a scant 5.5 poundsbut it's lighter than either the MC7803u (7.7 pounds) or the 6930G (7.2 pounds). The 16-inch widescreen is stunning and uses HP's BrightView technology, which supposedly makes screen displays more vivid. The 1,366-by-768 resolution, however, is generic for a screen of the dv6t's dimensions. Resolution is often an area vendors skimp on when they're trying to hit prices like that of the dv6t. More expensive 16-inch laptops like the <p>HP HDX16t</> and the <p>Dell Studio XPS 16</>, for instance, have options for 1080p (1,920-by-1,080) resolutions, on top of their richer feature sets. The dv6t (1054CL)'s dark interior minimizes reflective glare, whereas the HP HP dv6t (1030us) has a much lighter chrome finish inside that can be bothersome when you are working under a fluorescent light. The keyboard is fantastic, and it even comes with an adjacent numeric keypad, which you'd normally find only on larger (17-to-18-inch) media centers. You really get your money's worth in features. The dv6t (1054CL) is loaded with goodies, including a pair of USB ports on each side. One of them doubles as an eSATA port, so if the cavernous 500GB hard drive isn't spacious enough, you can attach an external one while taking advantage of SATA's blazing throughput speeds. The HDMI port is also handy to have, in case you want to view your photos, videos, and movies on a big-screen LCD TV. These ports aren't unique to the 1054CL model, though; all the laptops mentioned in this review have eSATA and HDMI ports, including the dv6t (1030us), which can be purchased from Staples. Other features include a 5-in-1 card reader, built-in Wi-Fi (802.11n), and Bluetooth. Costco online will let you upgrade parts and accessories as if you're ordering from HP's Web site. So if you want to add a bigger, 12-cell battery ($49), a Blu-ray drive ($125), or more memory, you can do this at Costco.com. Otherwise, only this particular version of the dv6t is available in the store. I'd recommend that, as soon as you turn the system on, you get rid of most of the third-party and HP-branded applications that reside in Program Features, accessed through the Control Panel. The dv6t (1054CL) isn't as slow as the dv6t (1030us) because it runs a faster processor and can handle the software overdose, but it comes with lots of useless apps that could slow down your system over time. The dv6t (1054CL) comes with a two-year parts and labor warranty. Costco doesn't sell extended warranties. The 2.13-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P7450 is about two grades better than the processors found in the MC7803u, 6930G, and the dv6t (1030us), and is better equipped to handle a huge software load, for instance. We know that this laptop can easily perform general-purpose tasks like Web surfing and word processing, and it's also fast enough to handle video editing, photo editing, and high-definition video viewing. On video-encoding tests, it beat the dv6t (1030us) by 9 seconds, an 11 percent improvement. In PCMark Vantage tests, a better gauge of overall performance, it outperformed the dv6t (1030us) by over 20 percent. Because the Lenovo Y650 uses a faster processor (a 2.4-GHz P8400), its video encoding and PCMark Vantage scores easily beat those of the dv6t (1054CL). But against the odds, the dv6t (1054CL) beat some of the models with faster processors, including the Lenovo Y650 and the <p>HP HDX16t</>, on the CineBench R10 test. Again, the processor is upgradable if you desire a speedier machine. Graphics performance is also reflected in the price. The dv6t (1054CL) costs about $200 more than the dv6t (1030us) because it runs a fairly powerful ATI graphics cardalong with a faster processor and bigger hard drive. This particular configuration is tailored for gaming, as it performed well enough on the 3DMark 06, Crysis, and World in Conflict benchmark tests to make any lag undetectable. If you don't need exceptional graphics performance, save some money by opting for integrated graphics. You'll gain more in battery life, too. Discrete graphics caused the dv6t (1054CL) and its 47-Wh battery (standard six-cell) to chalk up a below-average 2 hour 48 minute battery score on MobileMark 2007. The system falls behind the Lenovo Y650 (3:05) and the Acer 6930G (3:20), which use similar-size batteries but go with integrated graphics. Unlike those two, however, the dv6t (1054CL) comes gives you the option to purchase an additional battery through Costco's or HP's Web site. Depending on what your digital activities are, the <p>HP Pavilion dv6t (1054CL)</> may or may not be the best bargain. A midrange graphics card, a huge hard drive, and the fast processor are geared toward performance enthusiasts, as well as the average Joe. If your activities are limited to Web surfing and word processingor other general-purpose taskssave yourself $200 and go with the dv6t (1030us) or the Acer Aspire 6930G. If you want more potent performances parts and a broad feature set, the 1054CL is a good deal. Check out the <p>HP Pavilion dv6t (1054CL)</>'s performance test results.
