A well-equipped budget laptop, like the HP Pavilion g7-2160us ($629.99 list at Staples), can be a good fit for the dorm room or family home. It's great for completing day-to-day tasks, as well as casual gaming and light photo editing. It may not have all of the latest features, but it offers a large hard drive, an Intel Core i3 processor, and big, bright 17-inch screen, for a decent price. Design The g7-1260us has a sleek, simple look, the two-toned color scheme nicely contrasts its silver-grey lid and palm rest against a dark charcoal grey plastic chassis. The plastic construction flexes a bit, but still feels fairly rigid when you pick it up. The size of the g7-1260us (1.44 by 16.22 by 10.55 inches, HWD), making it more of a stationary desktop replacement. It weighs 6 pounds, which is lighter than the 17-inch <p>Gateway NV77H05u</> ($629.99 list, 3 stars) (6.5 pounds), but still nowhere near as commuter-friendly as the lighter 15-inch <p>Asus U56E-BBL5</> ($649.99 list, 4 stars) (5.5 pounds). The g7-1260us has a large 17.6-inch widescreen that displays in 1,600-by-900 resolution, the same resolution offered on the <p>Gateway NV77H05u</>. The screen has a bright LED backlight that offers better visibility in brightly lit environments, and is large enough to tile two windows side by side for multitasking. The g7-1260us has SRS Premium Sound software enhancement, but while it may offer clean sound at decent volumes, it can't make up for the lack of bass, or for its sound distortion at high volume. The full-size keyboard and numeric pad have a traditional layout, as opposed to the spaced-out keys on chiclet-style keyboards. The keys type quietly, but they provide very little resistance. Some people may prefer a mushy keyboard, but I do not. The trackpad is molded seamlessly into the palm rest, but the textured surface is easy to distinguish by feel. It supports multitouch gestures, like two-finger scrolling and zoom, and the separate right and left mouse buttons click quietly. Features The g7-1260us has a basic feature set from top to bottom, from it's integrated webcam to it's three USB 2.0 ports. You won't find any of the faster USB 3.0 or eSATA ports seen in competitors, like the <p>Gateway NV77H05u</>. But all of the basic ports and connectors are there, like headphone and microphone jacks, a case lock slot, VGA video output, HDMI output for connecting to an HDTV, and an integrated card reader (SD, MMC). A DVD burner lets you watch movies and burn data to discs. Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n Wi-Fi gives you wired and wireless networking options. What you won't find are amenities like WiDi 2.0, a wireless alternative to HDMI found on many mainstream and budget laptops, including the <p>Asus U56E-BBL5</>. The g7-1260us comes equipped with a 640GB 5,400rpm hard drive, similar to the 640GB drives found in the <p>Gateway NV77H05u</> and <p>Asus U56E-BBL5</>, and a step up in capacity from the 500GB drive found in the <p>HP Pavilion g7-1033cl</> ($649.99 list, 4 stars). It comes with Windows 7 Home Premium installed, along with Microsoft Office Starter 2010, a 60-day trial of Norton Internet Security, and HP QuickWeb. Some bloatware you may want to remove includes Blio book reader, a collection of game samples from WildTangent, Evernote, and desktop links to eBay, and a now defunct webpage touting HP's webOS and the HP TouchPad. Hewlett-Packard covers the g7-1260us with a 1-year warranty. Customers who buy this system from Staples can avail themselves of several services the retailer offers. This includes setting the new system up, data transfer from your old PC to your new one, software installation, and tech support and protection plans that range in price from $14.99 to $169.99. Performance While many value-priced desktop replacements utilize low-powered, inexpensive processors that are either out of date or better suited to netbooks, the g7-1260us comes with an Intel Core i3-2330M processor, a 2.2GHz dual-core CPU. Pairing this processor with 4GB of RAM, the g7-1260us provides plenty of muscle for day-to-day tasks, as well as basic gaming capability and moderate multimedia work. The g7-1260us scored 1,933 points in PCMark 7, and 2.5 points in Cinebench R11.5, scores right in line with the similarly equipped Gateway (2,004 in PCMark7, 2.04 in Cinebench) and the Core i5-equipped <p>Asus U56E-BBL5</> (1,920 in PCMark7, 2.60 in Cinebench). The g7-2160us completed Handbrake in 2 minutes 21 seconds, and Photoshop CS5 in 5:23. By comparison the <p>Gateway NV77H05u</> completed these same tests in 2:23 (Handbrake) and 5:44 (CS5), but the <p>Asus U56E-BBL5</> beat them both (1:55 in Handbrake, 4:13 in CS5). It may not be the right tool for a budding media artist, but for building the family scrap book, it'll do just fine. The g7-2160us experienced its biggest bump in performance thanks to the new Core i3 processor, which includes enhanced graphics processing as being part of the Sandy Bridge line. This improvement was significant compared to the previous line, which had far more limited graphics capability. In 3DMark 06, the g7-2160us scored 3,816 points at medium resolution and detail settings, and 1,928 points when cranked up to its native 1600-by-900 resolution. By comparison, the older HP g7-1033cl scored only 1,995 points at medium resolution, and 1,533 with the eye candy turned up. It also presents a huge improvement in gaming capability. The g7-1260us pumped out 19.3 frames per second in Crysis (DirectX 10), and 14.3 fps in Lost Planet 2 (DirectX 9), where the older system was unable to run either one. You should have no problem playing basic games like Portal or Team Fortress 2, but high-end games will be out of reach. The HP Pavilion g7-2160us has a 6-cell 55Wh battery, which lasted 4 hours 43 minutes in our MobileMark 2007 battery tests. It was slightly ahead of other 17-inch budget laptops, like the <p>Gateway NV77H05u</> (4:36 with a 6-cell, 48Wh battery) and HP g7-1033cl (4:05 with a 6-cell 47Wh battery). The smaller <p>Asus U56E-BBL5</>, however, lasted 7:43 with a larger 8-cell 74Wh battery. With it's 17-inch screen, 640GB hard drive, and Intel Core i3 processor, you may find that the HP Pavilion g7-2160us offers exactly what you need, even if it's missing a few forward-thinking features. Between the two-toned styling, nearly five hours of battery life, and decent all around performance, the g7-2160us will pique your interest.
