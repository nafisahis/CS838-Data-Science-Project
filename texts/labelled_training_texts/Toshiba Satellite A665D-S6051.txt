The <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S6051</> ($799.98 list), available at Staples, is a member of the company's new A660 line of 16-inch multimedia laptops. This retail model is based on AMD's new Vision platform and features a quad-core AMD Phenom II P920 processor. As our benchmark tests indicate, most users will be better served with a dual-core chip with a faster clock speed. Still, its application performance is still respectable, though gaming isn't much of an option because the A665D-S6051's uses integrated graphics. Too bad, too, because games would sound great on the laptop's small but mighty Harman Kardon speakers, which offer some of the best sound we've ever heard from an integrated set of laptop speakers. If movies and music are your thing and PC gaming is not, the Satellite A665D-S6051 makes for a great entertainment laptop. Design The A665D-S6051 is the Johnny Cash of laptops, dressed all in black. The lid, keyboard deck, screen bezel, keyboard, and touchpad are all black, presenting a monochromatic and fairly attractive appearance. Thanks to textured pattern that runs across the chassis, the laptop doesn't pick up fingerprints too easily. For a model that kicks off a new line for Toshiba, however, there isn't anything particularly noteworthy or striking about its overall look. The laptop weighs 6.5 pounds, average for its size. The keyboard features isolated keys, which offer superb feel. They're nearly silent during typing, even for a heavy typist like me. A number pad sits to the right of the keyboard, but nary a key was shortened to accommodate this addition. The touchpad has a matte finish, supports multitouch gestures, and feels very responsive. The keyboard also has backlights, but when you turn on the backlighting, the Toshiba logo in the front left corner glows blindingly bright, as does a strip of light along the top edge of the touchpad. Below the touchpad are two generously apportioned mouse buttons. Above the keyboard is a row of multimedia shortcut keys. Features The Satellite A665D-S6051 features a 16-inch widescreen display. It has the same 1,366-by-768 resolution found on 15.6-inch laptops, such as the Toshiba Satellite L655D-S5066 ($599 list, ). We thought perhaps Toshiba was simply rounding up and removing the decimal point, but when we got out our tape measure, the screen measured a smidge more than the 15.6-inch L655D-S5066 at exactly 16 inches on the diagonal. The screen features a glossy finish, which improves the look of photos and video but does create some glare and reflection. It's a good fit for an entertainment-minded laptop such as the A665D-S6051. A low-grade 0.3-megapixel Webcam sits above the display. The A665D-S6051's audio is the star of the show. Two Harman Kardon speakers reside above the keyboard behind oval-shaped grills, and they produce booming sound, for a laptop anyway. They offer louder, fuller sound than any laptop I've reviewed at this price. Most integrated laptop speakers suffice for Web video, are barely passable for a feature-length films (particularly those with soft dialog or loud explosions), and can't cut it for music playback. The A665D-S6051's speakers offer enough oomph for movies; we had to turn them down when seated right in front of the laptop. Listening to music is also an enjoyable experience, which is a statement I rarely make when describing laptop audio. In fact, Toshiba outfits the A665D-S5061 with a new featured called Sleep-and-Music, which lets you run your MP3 player through the laptop's speakers whether the laptop is on, off, or sleeping. Unfortunately, I didn't have the right cable to connect my iPod to the laptop's headphone jack, and one wasn't included in the box. The laptop offers a useful collection of data and video connections. You get four USB 2.0 ports (one of which doubles as an eSATA port), HDMI and VGA ports, and a media card reader and ExpressCard/34 slot. The combo USB/eSATA port offers Toshiba's Sleep-and-Charge feature, which lets you charge cell phones, MP3 players, and other USB gadgets. The A665D-S6051 features a 500GB hard drive and a DVD burner. For only $50 more, the 15.6-inch Editors' Choice <p>Samsung R580</> ($850 list, ) delivers a Blu-ray drive. The R580 also has a sleeker design and superior performance. Performance The Satellite A665D-S6051 features a low-end quad-core chip in the AMD Phenom II P920 CPU, plus 4GB of DDR3 memory and integrated ATI Radeon HD 4225 graphics. In the Labs, its extra processing cores failed to compensate for its slow clock speed of 1.6GHz. Similarly priced laptops with higher clocked dual-core chips outclassed the A665D-S6051. For example, the <p>Acer Aspire AS5741-6073</> ($699.98 list, ) features a 2.27GHz Intel Core i5-430M processor and posted a 45-percent higher score than the A665D-S6051 on PCMark Vantage. Even the cheaper Toshiba L655D-S5066, with a dual-core 2.3GHz AMD Turion II chip, bested the A665D-S6051 by 13 percent on PCMark Vantage. The Satellite A665D-S6051 was particularly slow on our CPU-intensive Photoshop test, where it took more than twice as long to apply various filter and effects to an image as Core i5-based laptops such as the Acer AS5741-6073, <p>Dell Inspiron 1564</> ($879 direct, ), and <p>Samsung R580</>. Perhaps you could argue that a quad-core chip like the Phenom II P920 offers a degree of future proofing; as more applications are released that can take advantage of four cores, the better its performance will look. While that may be the case some day, at the present its performance lags behind its dual-core competition. Also, the integrated ATI Radeon HD 4225 graphics preclude gaming that's any more intensive than World of Warcraft. The <p>Samsung R580</>, in contrast, throws in a low-end Nvidia GeForce 310M, which offers 512MB of dedicated video memory and decent frame rates. The Satellite A665D-S6051 uses a standard 6-cell (48Whr) battery and lasted 3 hours 13 minutes on our MobileMark battery test. That's slightly below average; other 6-cell laptops tested recently typically offer about 30 minutes more running time. If you are buying a laptop primarily to enjoy music and movies, the <p>Toshiba Satellite A665D-S6051</> is a great choice, thanks to the stellar audio its Harman Kardon speakers serve up. For general use, however, you can find better designs and performance from competing models.
