The best part about a media center laptop is that you almost never have to worry about feature and performance limitations. Yeah, it's deskbound and unlikely to see the inside of a backpack, but its size means you can cram in all the newest technologies, with few restrictions. The Dell Studio 17 ($1,411 direct) has a mind-numbing list of current and new technologies, the most compelling of which is a 17.3-inch widescreen that supports multitouch and an Intel quad-core processor that can bolt through any hardcore application. All this earns the Studio 17 our Editors' Choice in the media center laptop category. Design A media center laptop that crams in this many features and a large screen often forfeits aesthetics in the process. Even though the "Chainlink Black" design on my review unit is one of the least attractive looks, Dell offers other designs (200, in fact). With the Acer Aspire AS8940-6865 ($1,399 street, ), HP Pavilion dv7-3180us ($1,449 list, ), and Toshiba Satellite P505-S8010 ($950 street, ), there's only one option: A glossy plastic lid that attracts smudges and finger prints. At 8.6 pounds, the Studio 17 is the heaviest 17-inch laptop compared with the 7.4-pound HP dv7-3180us and 6.7-pound Gateway NV7915u ($600 street, ). The Acer AS8940 (9.1 lbs) and Toshiba P505-S8010 (9.2 lbs) are heavier than the Studio 17 because they come with larger 18.4-inch screens. Screen sizes vary with media centers; the most common fall between 17 and 18.4 inches. The Studio 17's 17.3-inch widescreen is not only bright and sharp, it's also versatile. The resolution is upgradeable to 1,920 by 1,080, though the 1,600-by-900 screen on my review unit is just as good. In contrast, the Toshiba P505-S8010 and Gateway NV7915u top out at 1,600 by 900. A multitouch screen is a rare find on a media center laptop. The Studio 17 offers one as an option ($175), though our review unit came with it included in the price. It responded beautifully to one- and two-finger (rotate, pinch, zoom) commands. It's not for everyone, as the screen tends to shake and vibrate when you press on it. Also, the resolution is capped at 1,600 by 900 if you configure the 17 with multitouch. I can see this option being used by artists, graphics designers and architects, chefs and home cooks, and as a learning and play tool for kids, but the average person can live without this feature. The option comes with a plethora of touch software, including Dell's Touch Zone혰nine touch shortcuts and applications arranged as an overlay on the desktop혰and Microsoft's Touch Pack for Windows 7 (A free download). The user experience follows the same recipe used across all of Dell's consumer laptops. I'm glad that the Studio 17 kept a traditional keyboard, where the keys are interconnected, instead of the chiclet ones that are becoming the norm these days. In my opinion, it's one of the best keyboards in the business, paired with a big touchpad and the softest mouse buttons you'll ever find on a laptop. Adjacent to the keyboard is a full numeric keypad혰great for number crunchers and avid Excel spreadsheet users. For an extra $25, you can add a backlit option, which lights up the keyboard in dimly lit environments. Features The list of features is endless and surpasses that of my previous Editors' Choice, the Acer AS8940-6865. The slot-loading optical drive can either be configured with a standard dual-layer DVD burner or a Blu-ray drive (a $150 option). If you buy the Studio 17 with the Blu-ray option, I would choose the 1080p resolution over the multitouch screen. You can stream what's on your laptop to any HDTV with any one of these three video-out options: HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA. Or, with ATI's Eyefinity technology (driver download), you can use all three ports simultaneously in a three-monitor setup, for a terrific panoramic view. The Studio 17 will support almost any external peripheral, given that it has 4 USB ports (one of which is an eSATA combo port) and a FireWire port. The usual slots and connectors, such as Ethernet, ExpressCard, a multimedia card reader, and three audio jacks (two headphones, one microphone) are present as well. For those who are into over-the-air (OTA) TV, the Studio 17 has an option for a TV tuner. And though 500GB doesn't seem like a lot of storage for a media center, the Studio 17 has the capacity to support two hard drives혰for a total of 1 Terabyte. The JBL speakers, located the palm rests, sounded crisp and better than the speakers on the Acer AS8940 and HP dv7-3180us. Performance My configuration came with a 1.6GHz Intel Core i7-720QM processor (there are options for a dual-core Core i5 or Core i3, depending on your budget). If you want the fastest parts in the world, this quad-core processor is the ticket. The Studio 17 comes with 4GB of DDR3 memory (expandable to 8GB) and a fast (7,200rpm) hard drive. These specifications amount to one thing: Superb performance. In video encoding tests, the Studio 17 scored 49 seconds, which beat the dual-core equipped Gateway NV7915u (57 seconds) and Toshiba P505-S8010 (57 seconds). Because its parts are similar to those of the HP dv7-3180us and Acer AS8940-6865, all three had very similar PCMark Vantage and Cinebench R10 scores. In Adobe Photoshop CS4 tests, the Studio 17 scored 26 seconds, edging out the Core i7 equipped Acer AS8940 and HP dv7-3180 in Adobe Photoshop CS4 tests. You're guaranteed a good graphics chip with a media center laptop, but how good is usually the question. This configuration ships with an ATI Mobility Radeon 4650 (1GB VRAM), which is a midrange graphics card that can handle most hardcore games and HD video formats. It trailed the Acer AS8940 in 3DMark06, but won in real-world games like Crysis (56.1 frames per second) and World in Conflict (48fps). It also outperformed the Nvidia solutions found in the HP dv7-3180us and Toshiba P505-S8010. Thanks to a huge 85WH (9-cell) battery, the Studio 17 outlasted all of its competitors in MobileMark 2007. It scored 4 hours 23 minutes, which beat the HP dv7-3180us's 73WH battery (4:03) by 20 minutes. The Acer AS8940-6865 fared the worst, as it barely broke one-hour mark (1:11) in the same test. The Dell Studio 17 (Multitouch) is as big as it is powerful. And when you have this much room to work with, cramming it with the most advanced features and parts seems like the natural thing to do. The Studio 17 is about choices, so if you're tied to a budget, you can forego a lot of the features and still end up with a superb media center laptop. For those who are aiming for the stars, this configuration has a quad-core processor, countless features, excellent battery scores, and a multitouch screen that lets your fingers do the working.
