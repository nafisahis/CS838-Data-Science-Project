Two laptops could be identical externally, but internally, made for different purposes. Gateway has been doing this with many of its laptops, including the "ID" series. The Gateway ID49C07u ($680 street, 4 stars), for instance, is wrapped in swank aluminum skin and combines the power of a Core i3 processor with a very tempting price. Its alter ego, the Gateway ID49C13u ($849.99 street), has the same exact look; only this time it runs a more powerful Core i5 processor and has Nvidia's Optimus automatic switching technology with a mighty Nvidia GeForce GT330M gaming card. The first is a budget laptop, while the other--the ID49C13u--is a part-time gamer's delight that's priced to please and considered one of the best laptops we've tested. Design Pulling off an aluminum lid at these prices is a rare feat. The few that do so, like the HP Pavilion dm4-1160us ($850 street, 4 stars), Asus U45Jc-A1 ($867 street, 4.5 street), and Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz) ($1,199 direct, 4 stars) are worth their weight in metal, but are also costlier. In contrast, the Dell Inspiron 14R ($820 direct, 3 stars) and Lenovo IdeaPad Z560 ($750 direct, 3 stars) have tops made of plastic. While it measures only about an inch thick, the ID49C13u is not the lightest 14-inch laptop with an optical drive, as its bottom half is made of plastic. It's as heavy as the Asus U45Jc-A1 (4.7 lbs), but lighter than the Dell 14R (5 lbs). At 4.4 pounds, the HP dm4 is the lightest 14-inch laptop with an optical drive. The 14-inch widescreen has good viewing angles, but isn't really any different than other screens in this class. That's because its resolution, like every other 14-inch laptop, is limited to 1,366 by 768. A 1,600 by 900 resolution on a 14-inch widescreen is available on the HP Envy 14's ($1,286 direct, 4 stars), but you'll have the pay a premium. The keyboard is made up of large chiclet-like keys. There's little spacing between the keys, unlike the bigger gaps created by the smaller keys found in the HP dm4 and MacBook Pro 13-inch. Typing on the keyboard, however, leaves little to be desired: Flexing is detectable toward the center, and the sound coming from the keys is like the clickety-clack noises of an old typewriter. A glowing touchpad, which is done purely for show, flashes every time you click it. If this annoys you, this feature can be turned off in software. The touchpad also doubles as a pair of mouse buttons, similar to the clicking touchpads found in the MacBook Pro and the HP dm4. It's a noisy, springy clicking experience, one that takes a while to get used to and will surely annoy the person sitting next to you. Otherwise, the tap feature is recommended, since it doesn't require a physical click and incorporates multitouch gestures. The multitouch gestures didn't interfere with the navigating experience, which is more than I can say for the erratic touchpad in the HP dm4-1160us. Features Gateway receives credit for stocking the ID49C13u with 4 USB ports, one more than the three found in the Asus U45Jc-A1 and HP dm4-1160us. It has an HDMI port, so that a compatible cable can connect the laptop to an HDTV or flat panel. Despite how thin it is, the ID49C13u squeezed in a dual-layer DVD burner, similar to the one found in its 14-inch counterparts. A 500GB hard drive is included, though an eSATA port is not available for storage expansion. The dm4-1160us and Dell 14R, on the other hand, have a combo eSATA/USB port . Performance Gateway spared little expense filling the ID49C13u with top-of-the-line components. It comes with a powerful 2.53GHz Intel Core i5-460M CPU that not even the Asus U45Jc-A1 and Dell Inspiron 14R can pull off at this price. The processor is also speedier than the one found in the HP dm4-1160us (a 2.4GHz Core i5-450M). Paired with 4GB of DDR3 memory, the ID49C13u earned top marks in Handbrake (2:44), Cinebench R11.5 (2.29), and Adobe Photoshop CS5 scripts (4:55). It placed second behind the dm4-1160us (6,247) in PCMark Vantage (6,012) tests, both of which broke the 6,000 mark, making the ID49C13u an excellent overall performer. Ramping processor speeds isn't its only refinement over the Gateway ID49C07u: The ID49C13u is the first Gateway laptop to leverage Nvidia's Optimus technology. Like the Asus U45Jc-A1, it runs a dual-graphics system that automatically switches back and forth between an Nvidia chip (for 3D games and high definition video) and an Intel one (for battery savings). The Nvidia GeForce GT 330M is a more powerful graphics chip than the GeForce 310M found in the Asus U45Jc-A1. It beats having a lone graphics solution, like the integrated one found in the HP dm4-1160us and Lenovo Z560. As expected, the ID49C13u bulldozed its way to the top in gaming tests such as 3DMark06 (7,893 at 1,024 by 768 resolution, 6,668 at native) and Crysis (42.3fps at Medium settings, 10.1fps at High settings). When the laptop isn't doing anything graphics-intensive, it defaults to the Intel integrated solution. It's the reason why the ID49C13u did well in the MobileMark 2007 battery test. Even though its 49WH battery is one of the smallest in this group, its 5 hours 30 minutes outlasted the Dell 14R (3:30), which uses a similar battery and an ATI gaming chip. It beat the HP dm4-1160us (5:30) and ID49C07u (5:31) by over 20 minutes, both of which use integrated graphics only. Alas, battery longevity is one part energy efficient components and the other battery capacity. For this reason, the U45Jc-A1's 84WH battery (9:27) easily took top honors in MobileMark 2007. The Gateway ID49C13u seduces with an aluminum design that not many can pull off for $850, let alone put in premium components like a Core i5 processor and Nvidia Geforce GT 330M graphics. It's a powerful laptop, wrapped in a gorgeous, portable body. Gateway went a little too far with the clickety-clack keyboard and glowing touchpad, and despite scoring well in battery tests, it's was no match for our Editors' Choice, the Asus U45Jc-A1, with its over nine hours of battery life.
