The MSI GT70 2PC Dominator ($2,351 as tested) is a beefy, 17-inch, midrange gaming laptop boasting the latest hardware from Intel and Nvidia, and features like a customizable keyboard backlight and Blu-ray drive. It has one or two rough spotsnamely no adequate touchpad support for the optimal Windows 8 experiencebut aside from minor flaws, it delivers a powerful gaming rig for a reasonable price, and earns our Editors' Choice for midrange gaming laptops. Design The MSI GT70 2PC Dominator will look familiar to anyone who has used MSI's gaming laptops before, since the chassis is similar to past systems, like the MSI GX70 3Be-007US, or the iBuyPower Valkyrie CZ-28, which uses the same chassis design. The 8.3-pound notebook measures 2.2 by 16.9 by 11.3 inches (HWD), and has black, brushed aluminum across the lid and palm rest. The laptop is equipped with a well-built, chiclet-style keyboard from SteelSeries. It offers several colors of backlighting, with different zones that can be set to nearly any color of the rainbow. The keys travel smoothly, with adequate depth and no flexing of the underlying deck. The accompanying touchpad is also fairly good, with discrete right and left buttons, but it lacks basic Windows 8 gestures, like swiping in from the edges. The previous Editors' Choice for midrange gaming laptops, the Asus G75VW-DH72, handled those gestures with ease. The 17.3-inch screen boasts a 1,920-by-1,080 resolution, and has a matte finish to reduce glare and reflectivity. The display looks good, with true colors and wide viewing angles, but it lacks touch capability. While this isn't unusual for gaming laptops, it means that the touch input so essential to Windows 8 is relegated entirely to the touchpad, with its incomplete gesture support. Finally, the GT70 2PC Dominator is outfitted with two stereo speakers and a built-in subwoofer. While playing our bass test track, "Silent Shout", by the Knife, that subwoofer provided decent bass, thumping right along when most laptops can barely offer anything in the low end. When watching the latest trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past, the dialogue and music was clear, while the various explosions and sound effects all had a little extra weight to them. Features With ports and connectors situated on the right, left, and rear of the laptop, the GT70 2PC Dominator is equipped with five USB ports (three USB 3.0, two USB 2.0), HDMI, VGA, and miniDisplayPort for video output, an SD card reader, and headphone and microphone jacks. The system also boasts a Blu-ray/DVD+-RW combo drive. A Killer DoubleShot configuration network adapter provides both Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n Wi-Fi, with optimizations for gaming, like prioritization for latency-sensitive application traffic. It also offers Bluetooth 4.0 + HS, perfect for connecting a wireless headset. For speedy performance, the GT70 2PC Dominator features a 128GB solid-state drive (SSD), and a larger 1TB, 7,200rpm hard drive for storage. Pairing solid-state storage with traditional spinning hard drives provides a wealth of storage space at a reasonable price, while still offering the performance boost from using an SSD boot drive. Our review unit came preloaded with Windows 8.1, and a few extra utilities, like SteelSeries Engine, which provides dashboard controls for customizing the keyboard backlight. It also comes with Nvidia GeForce Experience, which offers simple driver management and settings adjustments, but adds new features, such as DVR-like recording and streaming of gameplay (ShadowPlay), wireless streaming to an Nvidia Shield (Game Stream), and Battery Boost, combining automatic system optimizations and frame-rate targeting to keep you gaming at a high level while on battery power. MSI covers the GT70 2PC Dominator with a one-year warranty on parts and labor. Performance With a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-4800MQ quad-core processor and 16GB of RAM, the GT70 2PC Dominator offers solid performance for gaming and productivity alike. The system completed PCMark7 with a score of 6,073 points, making it one of the more capable gaming laptops in this price range, but it fell slightly behind the Eurocom X3 (6,281 points) and the Origin EON17-SLX (2014) (6,446 points). In multimedia tests, the laptop completed Handbrake in 32 seconds and Photoshop in 3 minutes 17 seconds, fast enough even for prosumer-level photo and video editing. The GT70 2PC Dominator is outfitted with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 870M. With the latest graphics card, the system produced 3DMark 11 scores of 10,282 points (at Entry settings), and 2,315 points (at Extreme settings). In gaming tests, the GT70 2PC Dominator was good, but not exactly dominant. At baseline settings (1,368-by-768 resolution, and medium detail settings) it scored 125 frames per second (fps) in Aliens vs. Predator, and 99 fps in Heaven, while at 1,920-by-1,080 resolution and higher detail, it pumped out 36fps in Aliens vs. Predator and 38fps in Heaven. These are very good scores, easily outpacing the Asus G75VW-DH72, and showing that the system will easily handle even demanding new titles at full resolution without dropped frames or jittering. That said, it fell short of more recent competitors, like the Eurocom X3, and the dual-GPU-equipped Origin EON17-SLX (2014). In our battery rundown test, the MSI GT70 2PC Dominator lasted 3 hours 19 minutes. While this was well ahead of systems like the Origin EON17-SLX (1:13), and Lenovo IdeaPad Y510 (2:21), it fell short of both the portability-minded MSI GE40 2OC-009US (6:14) and the similarly equipped Eurocom X3 (3:42). Despite this, you'll still be able to enjoy gaming performance on battery power, thanks to Nvidia's Battery Boost. Conclusion The MSI GT70 2PC Dominator has all the right ingredients for a top-flight gaming PC, with the latest Intel and Nvidia hardware, a Blu-ray drive, and finer touches, like a customizable backlit keyboard and built-in subwoofer. While we would like to see better touchpad support for Windows 8 gestures, it's a small complaint on such a potent gaming system. In terms of performance alone, the MSI GT70 2PC Dominator is well ahead of the Asus G75VW-DH72, and easily replaces it as our Editors' Choice for midrange gaming laptops. If you want even more performance horsepower, you'll need to pay for it, leaving midrange gaming rigs behind and opting for premium systems like the Origin EON17-SLX (2014), which put up better benchmark scores but costs $1,300 more.
