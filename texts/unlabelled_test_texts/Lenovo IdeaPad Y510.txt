The ThinkPad brand is an iconic image in the corporate world, but Lenovo has been absent from the U.S. consumer laptop marketuntil now. The company's recently launched the IdeaPad line as its first set of non-business models to debut on these shores. Think of the 15.4-inch IdeaPad Y510 as the ThinkPad T61 Widescreen's alter ego, albeit with some trendier features, such as a fabric-like cover, a "frameless" widescreen, and five speakers, including a subwoofer. One gets the sense that Lenovo's foray into our consumer market is tentative, because the Y510 and the rest of the IdeaPad line (there's also a 17-inch version, and a couple of configurations of the model reviewed here) are not being sold on Lenovo's Web site. You can get them only through retailers, both online and brick-and-mortar. Even so, the new design and an $899 (street) price tag are worth a trip to Office Depot or J&R Music World to check out. The Y510's cover finish is designed to look as if it was made out of fabric, though it's really a textured plastic layer over a plastic framequite different from the glossy finishes on the HP Pavilion dv6500t and the Gateway M-150X or the aluminum trim on the Dell XPS M1530 and the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Penryn), and not at all bland like the cover on the Fujitsu LifeBook A6120. The IdeaPad is not as thin as the MacBook Pro. Its dimensions (14.2 by 10.2 by 1.3 inches) are more in line with those of the LifeBook A6120, although it's not as boxy-looking. The real treat the Y510 offers is its screen design. Lenovo calls it frameless, as the borders surrounding the screen are concealed: The glossy coating over the screen extends to cover the borders as well, giving the whole thing a unified look. The widescreen measures 15.4 inches; its resolution is a modest 1,280-by-800, yet picture quality for watching videos and editing photos is superb. If you're looking for the brightest screen, the Fujitsu LifeBook A6120's, at 450 candelas per square meter, is the one to beat, but the Y510 is bright enough to please most people. The hinges on the Y510's screen are placed lower than most, almost hidden from direct view, making the screen look bigger than it is. Although not quite in the same class as the legendary ThinkPad keyboards, the Y510's full-size keyboard delivers a very pleasant typing experience. The keys are less resistant than ThinkPad keys. You won't find Lenovo's signature pointing stick, but the large touchpad handles all your navigation needs with grace. Lenovo has made other tweaks to liven up the laptop's aesthetics: The touch-sensitive multimedia keys above the keyboard are a particularly nice touch. I'm not so sure about the bright orange "Shuttle" keys (made up of a volume rocker and a toggle button) on the right side of the keyboard, though. Sound quality on the Y510 is impressive. Four speaker grilles are visible from the top, including two alongside the keyboard and two under the screen, pumping out sound better than the Fujitsu LifeBook A6120, the Dell XPS M1530, or the HP Pavilion dv6500t. Furthermore, the Y510 integrates a subwoofer, as the fifth speaker, in the base, and has a Dolby Home Theater audio chipset. This sound system is stacked. The Y510 has a typical selection of drives and ports, including a dual-layer DVD drive, three USB ports, a FireWire port, and a six-in-one card reader. It would be more impressive if it came with an HDMI port, as does the Dell XPS M1530. The 250GB, 5,400-rpm hard drive comes close to being an outstanding feature, but other systems are venturing down this road too: The Apple MacBook Pro, for instance, integrates a similar drive, and the Fujitsu LifeBook A6120 comes with a 300GB hard drive. The Y510 integrates a 1.3-megapixel webcam, which, with the special software bundle that comes with the system, can be used for several things: for example, Lenovo's EasyCapture software makes it easy to take pictures or shoot video clips for YouTube, MySpace, or any video-sharing service; and the VeriFace facial-recognition software allows the webcam to verify your identity by scanning your face. (The software does six facial scans as part of the enrollment process; afterwards, VeriFace will prompt you to align your face with the webcam at the Windows log-in screen. It's not meant to be an IT-level security device, but rather an easier way to log in than typing in a long password.) With performance, you get what you pay for. The 1.67-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T5450 CPU and 2GB RAM aren't going to win any performance contests, but these parts will satisfy the average user: If you surf the Web, watch the occasional movie, and edit a photo (or even a video) every now and then, the Y510 has the horsepower to tackle these tasks. On SYSmark 2007 Preview Overall, the Y510 outperformed the Dell Inspiron1420 and the HP Pavilion dv6500t configurations we reviewed. Keep in mind that more options are available with the Dell and the HP systems, because they are sold through their makers' Web sites, which allow you to specify a faster processor or more memory, or to tailor your system with a gaming card for under $1,000. Because you're spending more money on the Dell XPS M1530 and the Apple MacBook Pro, these systems will, obviously, be faster. Casual gamers should look toward the Dell Inspiron 1420 and the HP Pavilion dv6500t because they have options for dedicated video cards. The Y510's battery life wasn't stellar, but the 2 hours 58 minutes it scored on the MobileMark 2007 tests isn't terrible either. Unlike the Dell Inspiron 1420 and HP Pavilion dv6500t, the Y510 does not offer any extended battery options. The Y510 is environmentally friendly, as it is compliant with Energy Star 4.0 and RoHS standards, though it's still a little short of being PC Magazine GreenTech Approved. Lenovo hasn't filed for EPEAT certification for the Y510 yet, but is looking to do so later this year. As for my own energy-consumption tests (done with a PS3 International Kill A Watt meter), the Y510 registered 17 watts during idle mode. It has the same energy rating as the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Penryn) and is 2W more efficient than the Fujitsu LifeBook A6120 and HP Pavilion dv6500t. Average users who aren't pushing performance to the brink will love the look of the Lenovo IdeaPad Y510. The frameless widescreen and the textured lid exceed design expectations, while the sound quality is what you would find on a $2,000 laptop, not an $899 one. The one knock against it is that you can't upgrade to faster parts through Lenovo's site. The Dell Inspiron 1420 and the HP Pavilion dv6500t, on the other hand, have more options available to you. If you're not looking to play around with the configuration, I recommend that you at least stop by an Office Depot and test out the Y510. Check out the Lenovo IdeaPad Y510's test scores.
