The HP 2133 Mini-Note was (and still is) ahead of its time design-wise, with an aluminum finish that made the original ASUS EeePC 4G look like a toy by comparison. As one of the first netbooks that helped spur the ongoing revolution, it was enticingly presented and crafted to look like its EliteBook business siblings. But it wasn't without flaws. Specifically, the VIA processing innards were slow and required excessive cooling, resulting in significant fan noise and heat coming from the base. The newly minted HP Mini 2140 ($500 street) replaces the older parts with faster and more energy-efficient ones from the Intel Atom platform while keeping the impeccably fresh design intact. It's basically a business and education version of the HP Mini 1000. From the outside, you can't tell the Mini 2140 from its predecessor. The aluminum alloy finish, a glaring departure from the white lacquered designs of the Acer Aspire One, the MSI Wind, and the Lenovo IdeaPad S10, is what made the Mini-Note exceptional in the first place. The 2140, starting at 2.6 pounds (with the three-cell battery), is slightly lighter than the 2133. It's as heavy as the Mini 1000 (2.5 pounds) and the MSI Wind (2.6 pounds), and a bit heavier than the Acer Aspire One (2.1 pounds), the lightest in the netbook category. The 2140 could have been as light the Acer One had it not moved to a bigger screen. It now sports a 10-inch LED widescreen like those of the Wind, the Mini 1000, and the ASUS EeePC 1002HA, rather than an 8.9-inch one. The hinges are concealed when the lid is open, dropping down so that the bottom of the screen meets the system's base, which gives it a modern look. The optional 1,366-by-768-resolution screen is the first on a 10-inch laptop (HP is calling it its high-definition display). My test unit came with a 1,024-by-567 display, which is more consistent with the resolutions found on most netbooks, and it will save you a couple of bucks. The 92 percent keyboard is one of the biggest among netbooks I've seen, as big and as nice to type with as those on the Wind, the 1002HA, and the Mini 1000. The Samsung NC10-14GB, however, has a minuscule advantage with its 93 percent keyboard. As with its predecessor, an exceptional keyboard doesn't help the placement of its mouse buttons, as they flank the touchpad on each side. I found it easier to navigate with two hands. The 2140 ranks high in features. Its two USB ports don't sound impressive, but it forgoes a third USB port for an ExpressCard 34 slot, which is a better choice. This slot can be used to expand the netbook's capabilities by adding, for instance, a FireWire ports, extra USB ports, a TV tuner, or mobile broadband. Oddly enough, this business netbook doesn't integrate mobile broadband or 3G wireless. Meanwhile, the Mini 1000a consumer netbook, mind youdoes. Otherwise, the 2140 has an impressive selection of storage options, including 160GB (5,400- and 7,200-rpm) spinning drives or an Intel 80GB solid-state drive (SSD). Capacity-wise, the Samsung NC10 has a slight edge with its 320GB, 5400-rpm drive. Like all netbooks, the 2140 comes with an SD slot for digital camera cards and a webcam for video chat. For the 2140, HP offers what you could call "Accessories Galore!" It's a time-honored method of courting customers, and a good way to differentiate the 2140 from other netbooks. (I'm sure these accessories will eventually be offered across HP's netbook line, but for now, they're just for the 2140.) A USB dock, which houses USB ports and an optical drive, is available. You can also purchase stereo headphones that work with the 2140's standard Bluetooth connection. For those with a taste for fashion, a collection of colorful sleeves and carrying bags are available with your purchase. The only other netbook that has this many optional goodies is the Sony LifeStyle PC. And let's not leave out battery options: The 2140 comes standard with a 28-Wh (three-cell) battery, or you can upgrade to a 58-Wh (six-cell) battery for an extra $30the latter lasts for 8 hours on a single charge, according to HP. With the three-cell unit, the 2140 scored 3 hours 3 minutes on MobileMark 2007, which is on a par with the battery life of the Mini 1000 (2:58) but trails the ASUS 1002HA's score by 26 minutes. Performance is a complete turnaround from that of its 2133 Mini-Note predecessor, however. The VIA processor, coupled with S3G graphics, was simply too slow compared with other netbooks. Heat dissipation was another issue, as you can hear the fan noises kick in on a regular basis. The Mini 1000 was the first HP netbook to side with Intel, and now the 2140 gets the Atom platform as well. It has a 1.6-GHz Intel Atom N270, which is the CPU that every netbook is using, and you get 1GB of memory with Windows XP Home Edition. Two gigabytes of memory is available if you upgrade to Windows Vista Business or Vista Home Basic (or you could add a second gig yourself). SuSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 is also available on cheaper configurations. Since this configuration uses the same parts as most every other netbookAtom N270, 1GB of memory, Intel GMA 950 graphicsperformance scores didn't vary by much. Video-encoding tests finished in 4 minutes 32 seconds, which is 28 seconds faster than the Wind and the Mini 1000. The ASUS 1002HA fared better, with a score of 4:19. By keeping its original look intact, the HP Mini 2140 has a slight design edge on its competitors. The ASUS 1002HA is the only other netbook that has this scratch-resistant, somewhat-ruggedized, and sleek aluminum design. The Mini 2140 has more to offer in accessories than most netbooks, giving it an advantage there as well. Though the mouse buttons qualify for relocation, their awkward positioning is offset by the new Intel Atom parts, which translate into improved performance and better heat management. Because it's new, the 2140 is a bit pricier than the competition. The MSI Wind gives you the best bang for the buck, but if the 2140 can match it in price, it will become the netbook to beat.
