The Lenovo IdeaCentre A310 ($849 direct) all-in-one desktop, the update to the Lenovo IdeaCentre A300 ($949 list, 4 stars), adds some features, but keeps the same attractive design that makes both so distinctive. Lenovo has also lowered the price, so consider the IdeaCentre A310 a "plus" version of the A300. It's a prime option if you're all about modern design or you want a video-oriented all-in-one desktop. Design and Features The A310 comes in the same all-in-one chassis as the A300Â—an attractive minimalist white form factor with a pivoting and tilting-enabled screen. The screen is extremely thin, so the system looks diminutive from the side. The screen is so thin because the CPU and other components are built into the base. The chrome-plated arm holding up the screen is situated to the right, rather than in the center of the base. If you're a fan of the Luxo lamp or Apple's iMac G4 from 2002, then you'll enjoy this design. Unfortunately, since the design is so minimal, there's no space for an internal optical drive. Lenovo has attempted to rectify this with an external USB DVD burner bundled in the tested condiguration, but I would have rather seen an external Blu-ray combo drive, since the system's 21.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 and can display the true 1080p HD videos from Blu-ray movies. With Blu-ray, the external optical drive becomes worth the added annoyance. As it is, you'll use the DVD drive once in a while for ripping CDs or burning the odd DVD for a family member, but I foresee the DVD drive sitting in your drawer or in a closet most of the time. The desktop's wireless mouse and keyboard work with the built-in Bluetooth, and both are compact and styled to match the system. The A310 comes with a 500GB hard drive, a good capacity at this price point. Opening up a few browser windows while watching live TV in the MCE interface is no problem, thanks to the 4GB of memory that allows for optimal multitasking. In my review of the A300, I complained about the lack of an IR remote for Media Center and TV functions. Lenovo dropped an IR remote in the A310's packaging, along with an external IR receiver. Like the A300, the A310 comes with an ATSC/HDTV tuner, so the remote is a must for channel surfing. You need the IR receiver to use the remote, but it's an inelegant solution: IR sensors need to be built in, especially on compact all-in-one desktops. Like the DVD drive, I think some users will just leave the receiver in the closet. Both of these USB peripherals are noble fixes for perceived problems, but I prefer built-in optical drives and IR sensors so the system's svelte lines remain intact. The same applies to the desktop's external AC adapter, but I can overlook that offense, since the adapter can be hidden behind a desk. The TV tuner itself is great at pulling signals off the air in difficult situations (like in PCMag Labs, which is a few blocks away from a broadcast antenna), and the picture is smooth, crisp, and bright. The system comes with 4 USB 2.0 ports for external peripherals. The DVD drive and IR dongle can take up to three of those ports (the DVD drive has a two-plug cord), but at least the included keyboard and mouse are wireless. The system also has HDMI in and out, which is a rarity on inexpensive all-in-one desktops. That way you can use the A310 as a monitor for set topboxes like a cable company-supplied DVR; the desktop also supports external monitors, including HDTVs. Online videos displayed fine, including 1080p HD videos. The A310 comes with very little bloatware. There's a relatively short 60-day trial subscription to McAfee Antivirus, but that's about it for trialware. Thanks to Microsoft's new philosophy, the included Office 2010 starter doesn't expire. If you want advanced features like corporate workflow enhancements, you'll need to upgrade to a full version of Office online. The system comes with full versions of other programs like MediaShow (photos and slideshows), Power2Go (CD/DVD burning), and YouCam (webcam enhancements). Lenovo included LVT (Lenovo's support app) and Rescue System (built-in backup and recovery). Performance In terms of performance, the A310 is no slouch, thanks to its Intel Core i3 processor and 4GB of DDR3 memory. The system completed our Handbrake video encode test in a quick 3 minutes 8 seconds and Photoshop CS5 test in under 6 minutes (5:41). These are good scores for all-in-one desktops, at prices both above and below $1,000. For example, our touchscreen Editors' Choice HP TouchSmart 310 ($1,159 direct, 4 stars) took 2:56 for Handbrake and 6:42 for CS5. The A310's 3D performance was light, as is to be expected from the integrated Intel GMA HD graphics. You can play less strenuous 3D games on the A310, but don't expect to play resource-intensive games like Crysis and Lost Planet 2, at least not at any mid- to high-quality settings. The A310 is certainly fast enough to do what it does best: Display and decode video from HDTV over the air and online sources. I'd suppose the system would be fast enough to handle an external Blu-ray drive as well, if one were offered. In any case, it's nice to find a multimedia oriented all-in-one desktop that can both playback and edit videos/photos. The A310 treads the line between high-end and entry-level. It's much more capable than our entry-level all-in-one desktop EC, the HP Omni 100 , but it's behind the mainstream all-in-one EC, the Apple iMac 21.5-inch (Core i3) ($1,199 list, 4 stars). The A310 is too video-centric to be considered entry-level anyhow. The DVD drive and IR receiver clutter up the system's clean lines, since they are external add-ons. In this online-obsessed age, I'll forgive the inclusion of the external IR receiver before the external DVD drive, since a remote is much more useful overall than a part-time DVD drive. If it had been Blu-ray, it might have turned out differently. The A310 loses a bit of ground to other all-in-one desktops on the overall scores, but it's still a decent choice if you're looking for a 1080p all-in-one desktop PC that's video-oriented. If you can spare the ducats, the iMac is still the better buy, but if you need a compact all- in-one PC (and you can store the DVD drive in a drawer somewhere), the A310 is a stylish and worthy competitor, especially for the price.
