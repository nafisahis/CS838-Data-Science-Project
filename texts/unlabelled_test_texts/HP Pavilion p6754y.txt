The entry-level desktop is, by definition, not a system designed for media professionals or competitive gamers. It's designed to meet daily computing needs while not going over budget. The HP Pavilion p6754y ($559.99 list at Best Buy) checks all those boxes and still includes a few extra flourishes as well. Though not without its limitations, you'll find that the p6754y delivers strong day-to-day performance, copious amounts of storage space, and at a price that's easy on the pocketbook. Design and Features The p6754y has a fairly standard design: It's a traditional tower measuring 15.3 by 6.9 by 16.3 inches (HWD), with a basic black sheet metal housing. The front of the chassis features plastic panels with a gunmetal grey metallic sheen, trimmed with shiny chrome accents. Hidden behind one plastic panel is a DVD burner. The desktop also bundles in LightScribe label printing technology, you can print labels directly onto LightScribe discs without having to mess with any external label printers, adhesive labels, or special markers. Behind another plastic panel are two USB 2.0 ports, a headphone jack and a microphone jack. On back of the desktop are VGA and DVI-D ports for connecting a monitor, and an array of audio jacks that supports up to 7.1 surround sound. There are also four additional USB 2.0 ports, though two of those will be occupied by the included wired keyboard and mouse, which proved better than most of the ones bundled with low-priced desktops. The keyboard has a traditional layout with smooth-moving, solid-feeling keys. The mouse is lightweight, but it doesn't feel as cheap as others we've seen. The p6754y also comes equipped with a built-in 802.11n Wi-Fi card and a cavernous 1TB 7,200rpm hard drive. The p6754y also includes plenty of options for users looking to expand or upgrade their system. The included 4GB of RAM can be expanded up to 16GB. A free 5.25-inch bay is available in the front if you want to add another optical drive (perhaps Blu-ray), and another two 3.5-inch bays. There are two empty PCIe x1 slots and a PCIe x16 slot for a discrete graphics card. The p6754y comes with a bit of bloatware, but in an entry-level system like this, it's to be expected. While not all of these extras are unwantedI would have no problem with the dedicated Hulu and Netflix links, for examplethere were several unneeded HP branded utilities, like PictureMover and Roxio media viewer, as well as an assortment of generic ebook readers, like Blio, Kobo, PressReader and Zinio Reader. You'll also find trial versions of both Norton Online Backup and Norton Internet Security. Customers purchasing this desktop through Best Buy can take advantage of several additional offers from the retailer. Chief among them are Best Buy's 2- and 4-year extended protection plans, selling for $99.99 and $179.99, respectively. These extended warranties go well beyond HP's 1-year parts and labor warranty, and cover the system against normal wear and tear, power surge damage, and include a "No Lemon" guarantee in which Best Buy will simply replace the computer if it requires more than 4 repairs during the coverage period. Best Buy also offers a slew of other special offers, like discounts on printers, software, and tech support plans. Performance The p6754y comes equipped with an AMD Athlon II X4 640 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, and ATI Radeon HD 4200 integrated graphics. The p6754y performed reasonably well compared to its peers in the entry-level desktop category. In CineBench R11.5, a processor-intensive rendering test, the p6754y scored 3.32 points, putting it ahead of top performers like the Editors' Choice Dell Inspiron i580-8139NBC ($499.98 list, 4 stars) (2.62 points) and more than doubling the score of the dual-core CPU-equipped Asus Essentio CM1630-05 ($479.99 list, 4 stars) (1.58 points). The Pavilion p6754y performed just as well in PCMark Vantage, which measures overall system performance. It scored 5,997 points, surpassing every comparison unit but the Dell i580-8139NBC, which edged ahead with 6,287 points. For Web browsing, document creation, and basic productive tasks, the p6754y will do well, but heavy multitasking will result in noticeable slower performance. The ATI Radeon HD 4200 integrated graphics solution also provided strong graphics performance as seen in 3DMark Vantage graphics testing. At entry-level settings, the p6754y scored 2,351 points, beating out every system except for the Dell i580-8139NBC (3,975), equipped with Intel's integrated graphics, and Acer Aspire X3400-U2012 (2,587), which is equipped with a discrete Nvidia graphics card. None of the entry-level systems produced anything close to playable results in real gaming tests like Crysis and Lost Planet 2, which means that the only games you'll likely be playing with these systems are simple games like Solitaire and Farmville. Multimedia authoring is fairly limited on entry-level systems as well, though the p6754y is capable of the occasional photo task like auto-correcting color or cropping a photo to remove an unwanted background element.. In our multimedia tests, HandBrake and Photoshop CS5, the p6754y completed these tests in 2 minutes 32 seconds and 6:02, respectively. The only entry-level desktop to score substantially better times was the Dell i580-8139NBC (HandBrake 2:23, Photoshop 4:15). You'll want to trade up to a higher-level desktop if you do a lot of video or photo editing. Overall, you'll find the HP Pavilion p6754y to be well suited to work and school projects, letting you browse the Web, edit documents, and enjoy basic entertainment like videos and simple games. If you're hoping for advanced gaming or multimedia capabilities, you're probably browsing in the wrong section of the store, but for shoppers searching for an entry-level desktop, the p6754y does the trick. Picky buyers might want to choose the Editors' Choice Dell Inspiron i580-8139NBC, which had better performance, instead.
