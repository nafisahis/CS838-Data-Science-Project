Billed as a high-performance version of the popular Inspiron laptop series and featuring a premium design, Dell's Inspiron 17R Special Edition ($1,099.99 direct) hits the mark on both accounts. The Inspiron 17R's third-generation Intel Core i7 processor, switchable Nvidia graphics solution, and mSATA drive provide formidable horsepower, and the beautiful 17.3-inch full HD display is first rate. However, this media laptop practically screams for a Blu-ray player, and its battery life could be better. Design With the Inspiron 17R Special Edition, Dell engineers took the chassis used on the Dell Inspiron 17R-5720 ($699 direct, 3.5 stars) (review coming soon) and added some nice touches, including a textured matte black lid and a matching aluminum keyboard deck. Rounded corners and matte silver trim wrapped around the base and lid give the Inspiron 17R Special Edition a sleek, understated look. With dimensions of 1.5 by 16.4 by 10.9 inches (HWD), this 7.4-pound laptop is not very travel friendly, but you'd be hard pressed to find a 17-inch desktop replacement that is. For example, the HP Envy 17 (2012) and Toshiba Qosmio X775-Q7170 weigh 7.5 and 7.4 pounds, respectively. The 17.3-inch display is a beauty to behold. Unlike the Dell 17R-5720, it has a non-reflective matte coating that won't make you feel like you're staring into a dark mirror. The 1,920-by-1,080 panel handles full HD (1080p) with aplomb, delivering excellent image detail and vibrant colors. My 1080p test clip, The Magic of Flight, looked bright and sharp, as did the PC version of Duke Nukem Forever. Additionally, side angle viewing was much better than what we saw with the Dell 17R-5720. The full size chiclet-style keyboard is roomy and comfortable. It has a number pad on the right and is illuminated so you can find your way around in the dark. At the top of the deck are three Dashboard buttons, one of which is user programmable. One button launches the Windows Mobility Center, where you can change display and keyboard brightness levels, check battery status and change power settings, and enable or disable wireless radios. The other button opens Dell's Audio applet where you can adjust bass, treble, and other audio settings. The touchpad has a smooth surface and two wide mouse buttons; both are responsive and the pad provides plenty of room for gesture control. A pair of Skullcandy-branded speakers embedded in the front edge of the chassis and a subwoofer built in to the bottom of the base deliver crisp audio with a bit of bottom. Granted, you don't get wall-shaking bass from the tiny subwoofer, but it is a cut above the typical two speaker array found on most laptops. Features Ports are plentiful. On the left are two USB 3.0 ports, headphone and microphone jacks, VGA and HDMI video outputs, and the power jack. A 7-in-1 media card reader is located along the front edge of the chassis, and the right side holds two additional USB 3.0 ports and a LAN connection. Unfortunately, this model comes with a DVD multi-drive rather than a Blu-ray drive, which means you'll be watching DVD movies in standard definition. Or, you can spend an extra $200 for the Blu-ray version of the 17R Special Edition, which also features 3D capabilities. Storage comes by way of a 1TB drive paired with a speedy 32GB mSATA drive. Windows 7 Home Premium is the OS of choice, and as was the case with the 17R-5720, the drive has the Dell Stage media suite and Dell DataSafe backup software preinstalled. It also has a handful of bloatware products installed, including Wild Tangent games and trial versions of McAfee Security Center and Nero. Rounding out the feature set are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and WiDi wireless options. In order to utilize the WiDi feature (which wirelessly sends HDMI video to an external device such as an HDTV) you'll need the Netgear Push2TV adapter. Performance A 2.3GHz Intel Core i7-3610QM (Ivy Bridge) processor, 8GB of RAM, and the aforementioned 32GB mSATA drive propelled the Inspiron 17R Special Edition to the top of the PCMark 7 charts with an astounding score of 4145. That's more than 1200 points higher than the Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 (2,886). The disparity can be attributed to the Inspiron 17R Special Edition's mSATA drive, which is known to boost performance for this particular test. Scores were more equitable on our CPU intensive Cinebench R11.5 test, where the Inspiron 17R Special Edition (6.15) was outperformed by the Lenovo Y580 (6.22), if only by a slight margin. The Inspiron 17R Special Edition performed well on our multimedia tests as well, turning in scores of 1:19 and 3:21, respectively, on our Handbrake and Photoshop CS5 benchmark tests. The Lenovo Y580 managed a slightly better Handbrake score but lagged the Inspiron 17R Special Edition by 4 seconds on the Photoshop test. The Inspiron 17R Special Edition uses a switchable graphics solution to deliver enhanced GPU performance when it's needed, such as when gaming or using other graphics-intensive applications. An Nvidia GeForce GT 650M engine supplies the extra horsepower when the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 solution won't suffice. The Nvidia GPU produced an impressive 93 frames per second (fps) on our medium quality Crysis DX10 test but could only muster 23 fps on the high quality test. The Y580 scored 97 fps (medium quality) and 13 fps (high quality). Results from our Lost Planet 2 DX9 tests were similar; the Inspiron 17R Special Edition scored 82 fps (medium) and 29 fps (high) and the Lenovo Y580 scored 71 fps (medium) and 28 fps (high). You'll want at least 30fps to ensure smooth game play, so plan on dialing back on some eye candy if you want to take advantage of the Inspiron 17R Special Edition's native (1920-by-1080) resolution. The Inspiron 17R Special Edition couldn't complete our MobileMark 2007 benchmark test so ran our comparable 10-hour DVD rundown test to test its battery life. The 48Wh, 6-cell battery lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is enough to get through a typical movie but almost an hour shy of what we got from the Inspiron 15R Special Edition (3:10). The Y580 gave us 4 hours and 41 minutes of unplugged power, but the HP Envy 17 (2012) led the pack with a battery life of 7 hours 19 minutes. The Dell Inspiron 17R Special Edition is an attractive desktop replacement laptop offering serious productivity chops and enough graphics muscle to satisfy all but the most demanding gamers. Its 17.3-inch screen is ideal for watching movies and playing games, and its audio output, while not stellar, is still better than what you get with most laptops. Other than a smattering of bloatware, the Inspiron 17R Special Edition's only shortcomings are its weak battery life and lack of a Blu-ray drive. The Lenovo IdeaPad Y580, on the other hand, delivers similar performance, has a stronger battery, and it comes with a Blu-ray drive, which is why it remains our Editors' Choice for media laptops.
