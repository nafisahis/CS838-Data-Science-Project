If you’re on the market for a budget laptop, the first step is to assess your budget carefully. If you don’t have a low limit, you can find some machines that offer impressive performance and battery life; if you do, you’re going to have sacrifice something, though what and how much depends on what money you do have to spend. The Sony VAIO VPC-EH25FM costs just $599.99 (list) at Best Buy, and holds its own fairly well with other laptops that cost slightly more. It won’t dazzle you with either its features or its performance, but it’s nonetheless a capable system across the board. DesignAll black is the color scheme on the VPC-EH25FM, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s boring. The lid has a textured triangle pattern that gives it a real feeling of depth, and changes the laptop’s overall look depending on how the light hits it. You’ll find this finish inside, too, but only on the palm rest: The bezel around the 15.5-inch widescreen display, which uses the standard resolution of 1,366 by 768 and has a webcam embedded in its top edge, and the keyboard deck are both traditional matte black. So are the keys, for that matter, though they’re inscribed with easily visible white type and have rounded corners that give them a genuine distinctiveness. Adding some extra value to the keyboard is the fact that it contains a full-size number pad, not something you see on every laptop in this price range. The keys in general are easy to type on, though the space bar struck us as a little stiff. There’s a light texture to the multitouch-aware touch pad, and its two mouse buttons are light and springy when pressed. Weighing almost 5.5 pounds and measuring 1.5 by 14.6 by 9.8 inches (HWD), the VPC-EH25FM is about average in terms of portability and size. FeaturesThe VPC-EH25FM gives you the kind of hardware you should expect for a laptop of this price. It is powered by a 2.2GHz Intel Core i3-2330M CPU, which has two processing cores but can utilize up to four simultaneous threads through use of Intel’s Hyper-Threading technology. This processor, a member of Intel’s second-generation Core (aka “Sandy Bridge”) family, supports the full range of that line’s technologies, including Quick Sync Video (for faster conversion between video formats) and Intel Wireless Display, which lets you stream content from your laptop to your HDTV if you have a Netgear Push2TV adapter. This chip also provides the laptop’s video capabilities by way of the integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 system. Rounding out the internal vitals are 4GB of DDR3 RAM (expandable to as much as 8GB) and a 640GB hard drive (spinning at 5,400rpm). On the left edge of the laptop you’ll find two ports for outputting video to an external display, VGA and HDMI, as well as Ethernet, one USB 2.0, and headphone and microphone. PRO Duo and SD card slots, along with a switch for manually turning on and off the wireless 802.11b/g/n radio, are located along the VPC-EH25FM’s front edge. Adorning the right side of the system are three more USB 2.0 ports and the DVD burner; unfortunately, you’ll find no USB 3.0 ports on this machine for transferring data at speeds much higher than those USB 2.0 allows. There are no dedicated media keys on the keyboard; you’ll need to hold down a function key and then press one of the F1-F7 or F12 keys to access those functions and others. The only three special keys you’ll find are located in the keyboard’s upper-right corner: Assist, which launches Sony’s VAIO Care service; Web, which opens a Web browser; and VAIO, a user-configurable button that defaults to Sony’s media gallery software. The preinstalled operating system on the laptop is the usual Windows 7 Home Premium, and the system ones with a one-year limited parts-and-labor warranty. Best Buy also has an extended warranty program, which offers customers an extra year of protection beyond the one-year warranty of most system manufacturers. There are two plans in this extended warranty program. The standard plan ($119.99) covers the system against normal wear and tear, power surge damage, and includes a “No Lemon” guarantee in which Best Buy will simply replace the computer if it requires more than 4 repairs during the coverage period. Best Buy’s advanced plan ($219.99) offers all this, and also covers the system against accidental damage from drops and spills. Other special offers can be found online or in stores, like discounts on printers, software, and tech support plans which are available with any new consumer PC purchased through Best Buy. PerformanceGiven its components, the performance of the VPC-EH25FM was not particularly surprising: It finished near the middle of the pack in our benchmark tests compared with other similarly priced laptops we’ve looked at recent. Its score in Futuremark PCMark 7, which we use to measure overall system performance, was 1,865, the tiniest of shade short of the 1,866 you get with the Samsung Scala NP300E5A-A01UB ($599.99 list, 4 stars), a bit more outpaced by the 1,926 of the Toshiba Satellite P755-S5215, and well behind our two top scorers (and Editors’ Choices), the Lenovo IdeaPad V570-1066AJU ($629.99, 4 stars), with 2,275, and the Asus U56E-BBL6 ($699.99, 4 stars), with 2,255. We saw roughly equivalent results in our Handbrake video conversion test, where the Sony took third place with its processing time of 2 minutes 19 seconds, whereas the fastest, the Asus U56E-BBL6 and Lenovo V570-1066AJU, could do it in 1:50 and 1:52 respectively. The VPC-EH25FM’s time of 5 minutes 21 seconds in Photoshop CS5 also relegated it to third, behind the same two computers (though, with a time of 4:01, beat out the Asus U56E-BBL6’s by one second). Neither the U56E-BBL6 nor these other computers are outstanding choices for 3D gaming; they routinely returned frame rates in the mid or low teens on our Crysis and Lost Planet 2 tests (in both cases, at 1,024-by-768 resolution, with graphical details set to medium), with only the Gateway NV55S05u ($579.99 list, 4 stars) winding up playable, earning 36.7 frames per second (fps) and 38fps on the two tests. The VPC-EH25FM was not able to successfully run our MobileMark 2007 software, so we can’t give you concrete numbers regarding its battery life. For purposes of comparison, however, the comparably featured Sony VAIO VPC-EH14FM/B ($659.99 list, 3.5 stars), which we reviewed early this past summer, has a 44Wh battery like the VPC-EH25FM, and lasted just under five hours when not plugged in. It’s reasonable to expect much the same from this laptop: acceptable times, but likely not the 7 hours 42 minutes we saw from the Asus U56E-BBL6 or the 6:37 the Samsung NP300E5A-A01UB turned out. From battery life to performance, there’s nothing that the Editors’ Choice Asus UE56E-BBL6 doesn’t handle better than the Sony VAIO VPC-EH25FM—but it costs nearly $150 more. The Samsung NP300E5A-A01UB just surpasses the Sony on the features and performance fronts, and costs the same, though the VPC-EH25FM has a more eye-catching look. Which of the two is better for you depends on where your priorities lie, but regardless, the VPC-EH25FM is a solid middle-of-the-road choice.
