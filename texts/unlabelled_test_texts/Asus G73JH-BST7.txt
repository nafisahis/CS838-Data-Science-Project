The Asus G73JH-BST7 ($1,399.99 list, at Best Buy) laptop puts high-end gaming into an affordable price range, and delivers several winning details that many manufacturers would ignore. From its striking looks and unique cooling system to the Intel CPU and ATI discrete graphics card, the G73JH is a strong choice for gamers who know their hardware, but don't want to spend a lot for a competitive gaming laptop. Design The first thing you notice about the G73JH-BST7 is its distinctive design. Opting for understated menace rather than the gaudy designs favored by most gaming laptop manufacturers, the G73JH-BST7 is a black-clad beauty that draws inspiration from the F117 Stealth Fighter. A handful of LED accents provide indicator lights and the backlit keyboard with a cool glow that can be adjusted to the taste and needs of the gamer. The black plastic body tops off the angular lines with a matte finish and a rubberized palm rest. However, the stealth aesthetic doesn't stop at the case, as the F117-inspired look has informed several internal design decisions as well. The G73JH-BST7 has been designed to stay cool and quiet. The heat- and noise-producing components have been grouped toward the back of the unit, along with two heavy-duty cooling fans. Even as we put the laptop through its paces, placing some pretty grueling demands on processors and graphics cards alike, the unit never got warm and stayed whisper-quiet. With much of the hardware clustered in the rear of the machine, the back edge of the unit extends further than the hinge of the screen. This, combined with the 8.2-pound weight of the laptop, provides a base with far more stability than most laptops. The configuration also places the keyboard at an angle, providing an ergonomic 5-degree slope. This combination of comfort and stability make for a desktop-style playing experience with laptop mobility. Features The G73JH-BST7 tops off its widescreen with a 2-megapixel Webcam, and provides plenty of ports for peripherals. An Ethernet port provides an immediate LAN connection, or the 802.11n wireless connection can be used. External displays can be connected with either VGA or HDMI, and if the 640GB 5,400rpm hard drive doesn't offer enough storage, you can connect an external drive to any of the four USB ports, one of which is a combo USB/eSATA connection. The built-in card reader supports most flash memory formats (SD, MMC, MS and Pro). The keyboard has an adjustable backlight, and includes a numeric pad. Though the keyboard is full size, the numeric pad is not, and has been narrowed slightly, which may feel a bit cramped to some users. The keys are separated, but not in the chiclet-style seen on so many current systems. The keys provide the right balance of give and firmness, and more importantly, aren't distracting. The touchpad is smooth and responsive, and the rubberized texture of the palm rest provides a comfortable level of grip and dryness. Notably absent is a Blu-ray drive, which would have nicely expanded the entertainment options beyond pure gaming. The 17.3-inch widescreen offers 1,600-by-900 (720p) resolution, so it won't deliver in 1080p. The audio, on the other hand, is superb. The included Altec-Lansing speakers and EAX Advanced HD 4.0 sound provide some of the best built-in audio available. Buyers picking up the G73JH-BST7 can find it through Best Buy. While Asus includes a one-year warranty on parts and labor, Best Buy offers to stretch this protection to two years with its extended warranty options. The two-year warranty runs $199.99, while the advanced protection plan is $349.99. Performance The bottom line for any serious gamer is hardware and performance, and here the Asus really shines. The Intel Core i7 CPU Q740 provides plenty of processing muscle, placing it alongside some serious contenders, such as the Toshiba Qosmio X505-Q850 ($1,899.99 direct, 3.5 stars) or the Editors' Choice Acer Aspire AS8940-6865 ($1,399 street, 4 stars). In the PCMark Vantage productivity test, the G73JH-BST7 scored an impressive 6,357, easily outpacing many of this season's productivity-focused machines. Though the G73JH-BTS7 includes some great hardware, a few sacrifices were made to keep the price down. Though other, pricier entries in the G73 line utilize Nvidia graphics, the G73JH-BST7 (a Best Buy configuration) opts for ATI hardware. There are some capability differences between the two, but the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870 still packs a lot of punch. The ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870 graphics plowed through our toughest gaming tests without even blinking. It ran Crysis at 70 frames per second, and Lost Planet 2 at 90 fps, under medium settings. Even after ratcheting up the resolution the games ran smoothly, pumping out 26 fps in Crysis and 38 fps in Lost Planet 2 without so much as a hiccup. Our 3DMark06 test generally makes even the sturdiest laptop struggle, but the G73JH-BTS7 blew past them with a score of 12,716 at native resolution. That's better than the Alienware M17x's score of 12,434 and Toshiba X505's score of 6,607. The G73JH-BTS7 also made a decent showing in our battery life tests. Though it has an 8-cell, 75Whr battery, it lasted 2 hours 12 minutes when running MobileMark 2007. Gaming systems tend to chew through batteries quickly, and the G73JH-BTS7 is no exception. By comparison, last year's Asus G71G-Q1 ($2,000 street, 3.5 stars) scored 1:45, and Editors' Choice Alienware M17x scored only 1:25. While the G73JH-BST7 will have to be plugged in for an all-night gaming session, it provides enough life for one or two quick rounds on the road. Between the polished, gamer-centric design and the hardware under the hood, the Asus G73JH-BST7 would be a strong competitor in any price range. Compared with the Editors' Choice Alienware M17x, it offers similar gaming capabilities with a significantly lower price. At only $1,399.99, this unit offers serious gaming horsepower that even rookie gamers with a tight budget can get in on.
