The Dell Latitude 12 Rugged is a hefty Windows tablet built to withstand the elements. And it's MIL-SPEC certified, so it meets military standards for drop tests and durability. If you're, say, a paleontologist or a deployed soldier who needs a solid-performing in-field tablet that can withstand extreme conditions, it's worth considering. At $2,340.87 (as tested), its price is in line with other ruggedized tablets we've tested, such as the $2,400 Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 and our Editors' Choice, the $2,100 Getac F110. It doesn't offer the same level of performance as the Getac model, but the Latitude 12 Rugged is a good investment if you're looking for a durable machine with best-in-class battery life and solid multimedia capabilities. Design and Features The Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet is fairly big, measuring 8 by 12.3 by 0.96 inches (HWD), and weighing 4.46 pounds. The size and weight make it difficult to cradle it in the crook of your arm for extended periods of time. We've tested heavier ruggedized tablets, however, like the Xplore XC6, which weighs about 5.4 pounds. The Getac F110 is thinner and lighter at 0.96 by 12.3 by 8.15 inches and 3.1 pounds, and the Panasonic FZ-G1 even more so, at 7.4 by 10.6 by 0.8 inches and 2.5 pounds. The tablet's exterior is dust- and shock-proof, able to withstand drops from up to four feet. It's MIL-STD-810G tested and certified, meeting military standards for toughness. On the back is a kickstand that lets you prop up the tablet when the optional detachable $349.99 keyboard is attached. It's actually a chiclet-style keyboard and touchpad that's just as big and bulky as the tablet itself. It measures 8 by 12.3 by 0.5 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.56 pounds. Combine the two, and you're talking about a system that's almost an inch-and-a-half thick and weighs more than 6 pounds. The keyboard is very comfortable, however, although the touchpad feels a little small, but that's not a huge knock against it. The 11.6-inch In-Plane Switching (IPS) touch screen has the same 1,366-by-768 resolution as the Getac F110 and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The anti-glare display is easy to read both indoors and in direct sunlight. The panel looks a bit dull, however, and attracts fingerprints, but it's good enough for watching 720p videos. The similarly priced Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 has a 1,600-by-1,200-resolution screen. Around the screen is a thick, ruggedized bezel that also protects the 2-megapixel front-facing camera. Right below the screen are an auto-rotate button, volume controls, and the Windows button. There are also three programmable buttons that can turn on the built-in flashlight, mute the microphone, turn wireless on or off, or perform several other actions of your choosing. On the back of the tablet is an 8-megapixel camera with a physical shutter for when it's not in use. The rear camera takes clear photos and focuses quite quickly, while the front-facing camera is good enough for Skype and video calls, though not much more. All of the ports are covered by tough rubber flaps, but they have no locking mechanism, and are difficult to close securely. On the left side of the tablet, under a single flap, there's a headphone jack, a microSD slot, and an HDMI port. Above the flap is a microphone. On the right side, covered by two rubber flaps, are a serial port, a USB 3.0 port, and the Power connector. Right beside these flaps is the Power button. The top edge of the frame has another microphone and a front-facing camera shutter button, along with a detachable stylus with a cord tethering it to the body of the tablet. Our test unit came with a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD), which you can configure, and you can also get 128GB and 512GB configurations. This is in line with other ruggedized Windows tablets, like the Getac F110, which has a base storage of 128GB. The Latitude 12 Rugged comes with NFC and dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi capabilities, as well as a cellular 4G LTE option. Security features include a smart-card reader, a fingerprint scanner, Trust Platform Module (TPM) 1.2 (a type of cryptoprocessor that integrates cryptographic keys into devices), and Dell's own security tools for device encryption and password security. The tablet runs Windows 8.1, with a free upgrade to Windows 10, and is protected by Dell's three-year limited warranty. PerformanceThe Latitude 12 Rugged has a 1.2GHz Intel Core M-5Y71 dual-core processor and 8GB of RAM. While the CPU is more than capable for everyday tasks like spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, and performance was stron, similar rugged tablets returned better results in our testing. The Latitude 12 Rugged scored 2,620 points on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, which assesses overall performance for day-to-day computing tasks. It scored well ahead of the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 (1,470), but lagged behind the Getac F110 (2,942) and the Motion Computing R12 (2,833). See How We Test Tablets On multimedia tests, the Latitude 12 Rugged performed admirably. Its time of 5 minutes 14 seconds on the Handbrake test outpaced the Getac F110's 5:28, and it returned a Photoshop CS6 test time of 5:34 to the Getac F110's 6:28. This shows that the Latitude 12's Core M processor performs just as well as, or better than, the Intel Core i5-5200U in the Getac F110. While 14 seconds isn't a huge lead in Handbrake, it shows that a CPU that conserves energy can also return good multimedia performance. However, the Dell tablet fell short of beating the Motion Computing R12, which scored 3:39 on Handbrake. The Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet also does really well in terms of battery life. It ships with two hot-swappable 26-watt batteries that helped the tablet ace our rundown test. With both batteries installed, the Latitude 12 Rugged lasted 10 hours 41 minutes. That's longer than the Getac F110 (9:14), which also has two batteries, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 (5:04), and the Xplore XC6 (7:56). With just one battery, however, the Latitude 12 Rugged only lasted 3:21, while the Getac F110 lasted around 4:30 on a single battery. ConclusionThe Dell Latitude 12 Rugged is a beast of a tablet that's fully fit for the outdoors and treacherous conditions. It packs solid performance in a shock- and dust-proof body, and with two hot-swappable batteries, its one of the longest-lasting rugged tablets we've tested. The Getac F110 remains our Editors' Choice rugged tablet, as it is lighter to carry around, has more secure port covers, and costs almost $300 less than the Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet. But if you are in need of a tough tablet that will last all day and has strong multimedia capabilities, the Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet is an excellent choice. Just be sure to carry a big bag.
