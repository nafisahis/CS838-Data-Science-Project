The Dell Inspiron One IO2305-4429MSL ($849.99 list at Best Buy) all-in-one desktop is a vast improvement over the version from last holiday season. It has a faster processor, Blu-ray player, and more inputs, for an identical price. It's pretty close to an ideal HD video consumption system, and online HD videos look pretty good on the system's 23-inch screen. This system is perfect for the Blu-ray collector and people lucky enough to be in range of an over the air HTDV station. Design and Features The IO2305-4429MSL is the newest version of the year-old Dell Inspiron One IO2305-3114MSL ($849.99 list, 2.5 stars), so it's no surprise that it's visually identical to last year's model. Its main feature is a 23-inch screen with full 1080p HD (1,920-by-1,080) resolution. The screen is large and bright, if not quite as sharp as rivals like the Toshiba DX1215-S2101 ($879.99 list, 3.5 stars) or Apple iMac 21.5-inch (Thunderbolt) ($1,199 list, 4.5 stars). The desktop rests on two thin feet on the front, and an adjustable stand in back, which gives the user plenty of storage space under the system for the keyboard and mouse. The mouse and keyboard are both wireless, connecting to the PC via a USB dongle. The IO2305-4429MSL comes with a multimedia keyboard, featuring a comfortable key feel and multimedia controls like a rotary volume control. The IO2305-4429MSL has six USB 2.0 ports, but no USB 3.0 or eSATA. It has more than enough ports for today's peripherals, but you'll be out of luck if you use faster storage like a USB 3.0 or eSATA hard drive. On the bright side, the desktop comes with not one, but three external video-in ports: HDMI, VGA, and good old composite video. There are a few ways you can use this plethora of connectivity. You can hook up an external set top box like a cable company DVR, and use it as a TV). You can hook up another laptop to the system, for quick multitasking. You can even hook up an older game system or VCR using the composite video port. Plus, you can connect a newer PC once the CPU and graphics become "too slow," extending the life of the monitor beyond the point when the PC becomes obsolete. I think HDMI-in is absolutely necessary for any large-screen all-in-one desktop priced over $700, since it will give you that added life in the future. The Inspiron One's built-in speakers have a THX TruSound logo on them, and they are reasonably clear, but the sound is soft. When I turned up the volume up on the desktop, it barely registered at levels above a normal conversation. If you want to rock the house or replicate a movie theater experience, you'll either need to hook up external speakers or use headphones. The desktops built-in HDTV tuner was able to grab plenty of HD signals in our New York City-based PC Labs, viewing live HDTV was a cinch in Window 7's Media Center interface. Dell's pre-loaded software is somewhere between ideal and middle of the road, but closer to ideal. I applaud Dell for keeping the bloatware and trialware levels down on this system; about the only thing pre-installed, aside from Dell's software and Windows 7 Touch Pack, is a copy of McAfee Security Center with an unfortunately short 30-day subscription for updates. This is wrong, because McAfee.com will let you download a 30-day trial for any PC. New PCs should have at least 12 to 15 months out of the box, so your desktop doesn't get too infected right out of the gate. Also annoying is McAfee Security Center's attempts to up-sell you on a full subscription with pop-ups. Dell's included software is mostly useful, including an app for photo viewing and sharing (Photo Stage), as well as a pre-installed copy of PowerDVD that works with the Blu-ray player and is integrated into Media Center. The system comes with an IR remote for Media Center, so you can watch online content, HDTV, and Blu-ray movies from the comfort of your easy chair. Dell's Stage interface is a glorified launcher utility, and while it gives you easy access to photos, videos, and Web shortcuts, Dell Stage is pretty threadbare compared with the more polished and immersive touch-oriented overlays on Gateway and HP touch-enabled systems. Best Buy also has an extended warranty program, which offers customers an extra year of protection beyond the one-year warranty of most system manufacturers. There are two plans in this extended warranty program. The standard plan ($119.99) covers the system against normal wear and tear, power surge damage, and includes a "No Lemon" guarantee in which Best Buy will simply replace the computer if it requires more than four repairs during the coverage period. Best Buy's advanced plan ($219.99) offers all this, and also covers the system against accidental damage from drops and spills. Other special offers can be found online or in stores, like discounts on printers, software, and tech support plans which are available with any new consumer PC purchased through Best Buy. Performance The IO2305-4429MSL has adequate performance for a system of this caliber. We didn't have too much trouble viewing 1080p HD videos from YouTube and Blu-ray movies displayed smoothly. However, the desktop's AMD Athlon II X4 610e processor led to slightly slower multimedia creation scores (2 minutes 38 seconds in Handbrake; 6:59 in Photoshop CS5) than rivals. For example, the Toshiba DX1215-S2101, with its laptop-class Intel Core i5-24100M processor, is quite a bit faster (1:54 in Handbrake; 4:53 in CS5), and the Gateway ZX6961-UB20P ($779.99 list, 3.5 stars) with an Intel Core i3-2100 scored an even fast 1:40 in Handbrake and 3:47 in CS5. Performance on 3D benchmark tests was predictably weak: 10 frames per second (fps) on Crysis is not playable. That said, the desktop's ATI Radeon HD 4720 graphics is adequate for HD and light 3D in user interfaces, like Windows Aero. The other desktops in this class are also hobbled on 3D games. What this all means is that the IO2305-4429MSL is a good PC for multimedia consumption, but if you want to spend a lot of time and effort creating videos and photos, you may be happier with another system. Compared to systems in the same price range, the Dell Inspiron One IO2305-4429MSL is the one to get if watching HD video is your thing. It has a built-in Blu-ray player and TV tuner, both of which the Toshiba DX1215 and Gateway ZX6961-UB20P lack. The Gateway ZX6961-UB20P also doesn't have the IO2305-4429MSL video-in capabilities, though the Toshiba DX1215 at least has HDMI in. But both the Toshiba and Gateway all-in-one desktops were faster on the multimedia and day-to-day benchmark tests and both will serve a photo/video enthusiast better. The Toshiba DX1215, in particular, has an amazing looking screen for those with a critical eye. The current Editors' Choice for mid-priced all in one desktops is the HP TouchSmart 310-1125y ($699 list, 4.5 stars), and thanks to that system's exceptional touch overlay (HP TouchSmart) and lower price tag, the HP 310-1125y holds on to the crown.
