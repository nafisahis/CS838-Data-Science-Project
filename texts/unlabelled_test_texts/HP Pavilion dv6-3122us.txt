The HP Pavilion dv6-3122us ($649.98 list), available at Staples, brings a number of compelling features, including eye-catching good looks and an excellent price tag for a 15.6-inch desktop replacement laptops. Long battery life and a great-looking display only add to its appeal. But every Achilles must have its weakness, and the dv6-3122us's is its lackluster performance. Design The complete line of Pavilion laptops has gotten a recent makeover, and the new design has a simple elegance to it. The dv6-3122us's lid is has a metallic coating that HP calls "champagne," but it looks more like matte silver to me혰a subtle design is laser-etched across it. Perhaps the only unsubtle feature of the dv6-3122us is the HP logo in a lower corner of the lid that lights up when the laptop is in use. The lid's design carries over to the palm rest and keyboard deck, which is truly minimalist with just a power button and touchpad to accompany the chiclet-style keyboard. The keyboad and touchpad are both black, which offer a pleasing contrast against the lighter color of the surrounding chassis. The keyboard is fairly stiff, with little flex. Dedicated keys line the left side of the keyboard for launching the calculator app, printing, opening your dedicated Web browser, launching HP's MediaSmart toolbar, and opening the default mail app. The generously sized, 5-inch (diagonal) touchpad is flush with the palm rest and integrates the mouse buttons. The touchpad supports a number of multitouch gestures that I find far too easy to accidentally initiate혰we've run into the same frustrations with the touchpad on the HP Pavilion dv7-4083cl ($813 list, 4 stars). Measuring only 1.3-inches at its thickest point, the dv6-3122us has a sleek and stylish design. It weighs in at 5.36 pounds, which is on the light side for 15.6-inch laptops. But if you truly must have the lightest 15-inch laptop, then you should check out the Acer Aspire TimelineX AS5820T-5951 ($723 street, 4 stars) or Samsung R540-11 ($830 list, 4 stars), which both weigh 5.2 pounds. Features One of my favorite features of the dv6-3122us is its gorgeous 15.6-inch, LED-backlit display. Colors truly pop from the bright screen, making it a great choice for watching movies. I only wish the glossy screen didn't have the propensity to capture reflections as much as it does. The Altec Lansing stereo speakers (with Dolby audio support) pump out impressive-sounding audio that can get pretty loud, but they tend to snap, crackle, and pop when the volume is pegged to max. Including a 5,400rm 500GB hard drive seems to be the de facto standard these days for desktop replacements, and the dv6-3122us is a card-carrying member of this club; although the Editors' Choice Acer Aspire AS5745-7247 ($600 street, 4.5 stars, EC) breaks from the mold with a generous 640GB hard drive. One movie-friendly feature the dv6-3122us doesn't have, however, is a Blu-ray drive; but at this price point that shouldn't come as a surprise. You'd typically have to spend at least another hundred more to get a 15.6-inch laptop with a Blu-ray drive, such as the Samsung R540-11 or Toshiba Satellite A665D-S6085 ($798.98 list, 4 stars). The balance of the dv6-3122us's feature set is very respectable, with VGA and HDMI-out, 3 USB 2.0 ports, an eSATA/USB 2.0 combo port, 5-in-1 card reader, gigabit Ethernet, and an 802.11b/g/n radio. As we've seen time and again with HP systems, the dv6-3122us comes with a fair bit of installed bloatware. If you can wade through the superfluous apps and links to online services, you'll actually find a few useful applications, such as the HP MediaSmart suite that provides a coherent and useful interface for accessing and playing media, such as DVDs, music, and photos. Customers who buy this system from Staples can avail themselves of several services the retailer offers. This includes setting the new system up, data transfer from your old PC to your new one, software installation, and tech support and protection plans that range in price from $14.99 to $169.99. Performance Costing less than the average desktop replacement means the dv6-3122us is going to appeal to budget-minded shoppers. Those looking for great performance, however, are going to have to look elsewhere. The dv6-3122us's 2.4GHz AMD Turion II P540 dual-core processor simply can't compete with the more robust Intel Core i3 and Core i5 processors that power the majority of today's desktop replacements. For example, the dv6-3122us's PCMark Vantage score of 3,810 can't hold a candle to the 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-370M-based AS5745-7247's score of 5,252 or the 2.27GHz Intel Core i5-430M-based R540-11's score of 6,190. But the dv6-3122us did manage to beat the similarly priced Dell Inspiron IM5030-3413B3D's ($629.98 list, 2.5 stars) score of 3,376. This same scenario played out with the Cinebench R11.5 (1.39) and Photoshop CS5 (7:52) tests, where the dv6-3122us gets beat out by more expensive laptops, but pulls ahead of the Inspiron IM5030-3413B3D. With only an ATI Radeon HD 4250 integrated graphics engine sputtering along, the best the dv6-3122us could do on the Lost Planet 2 benchmark test at 1,024 by 768 resolution with medium settings is a measly 4.9 frames per second (think: really, really slow slideshow). Then again, most sub-$1,000 desktop replacements come with integrated graphics and fare about the same. You typically have to drop at least a grand on a desktop replacement before you get respectable 3D gaming potential. Perhaps what the dv6-3122us lacks in application and gaming performance it makes up in battery life, with an above-average time of 4 hours 49 minutes on the MobileMark 2007 test. This score is notably better than what the Dell IM5030-3413B3D (3:36) or R540-11 (3:07) could do; but the Acer AS5820T-5951 still has everybody beat with a jaw-dropping time of 7:37. As long as your performance needs are modest혰you mostly run just office productivity apps, send and receive e-mails, and surf the Web혰the dv6-3122us's conservative capabilities should be sufficient. If you need a faster machine and want to save a few more bucks, the Editors' Choice Acer Aspire AS5745-7247 might then be a better candidate. That said, the dv6-3122us's excellent display quality will appeal to movie mavens who like to watch their favorite films on the go. Its stylish good looks make it an excellent accessory for fashionistas, and its great battery life will make road warriors happy. But if performance is of primary concern and if the AS5745-7247 is not an option, then go break the piggy bank, because you're going to have to spend more money to get more horsepower.
