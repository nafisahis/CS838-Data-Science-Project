The Gateway One ZX4351-33e ($779.99 list) is an improvement over previous mid-price Gateway all-in-one desktop PCs, but is it good enough to unseat touch screen masters like the HP TouchSmart 310? It has a better price, better multimedia performance, and nicer styling than Gateway's previous mid-priced all-in-one PCs. But missteps in usability and quality in the day-to-day grind cloud the system's positives and leave the ZX4351-33e well short of a victory. Design and Features The ZX4352-33e features Gateway's new One design cues first seen in the Gateway One ZX6951-53 ($999.99 list, 4 stars). This time around, it a friendlier curvy design on the front bezel. It looks more futuristic and organic than the blocky Gateway One PCs of the past. The front of the bezel is clean, except for the large backlit power key. The system has a 21.5-inch widescreen, whereas the Gateway ZX6951-53 was equipped with a 23-inch one, and both have full 1080p HD 1,920 by 1,080 resolution screens. Since the ZX4352-33e is smaller, the screen bezel looks thicker than on competing all-in-one desktops. You'll get used to it, but on first flush the visible screen looks too small for the chassis. Got a Touch of The ZX4352-33e is one of the less expensive multi-touch screen PCs out there, and Gateway is improving its TouchPortal interface rapidly. It's constantly active in the background; all you have to do is touch an icon on the top right of the screen to bring it up. The TouchPortal interface then takes over the screen, bringing up a large clock and space for widgets, like weather and memos. You can jump back to Windows by tapping on a floating icon located two thirds down the screen that looks like the last screen you were working on before opening TouchPortal. The app icons are lined up at the bottom of the screen, which is an improvement over the haphazard groups of icons all over last year's TouchPortal screen: The available apps scroll left and right similar to how they appear on HP's TouchSmart interface. It's a little more dynamic looking than the Mac OS X Dock, but it fulfills a similar function. You can bring up a touch-optimized overlay for Internet Explorer, video and media players, and the usual Microsoft Surface apps. It's not quite as good as HP's current TouchSmart interface, but it's much more touch-centric than the simplistic Dell dock on the Dell Inspiron One 2305 (Blu-ray) ($1099 direct, 4.0 stars). When it works, the touch interface is responsive and snappy. One thing detracting from the touch experience was the uneven friction on the screen: It felt like its coatings were applied unevenly. Hopefully, it was a sample defect, and not indicative of the model line. There was also a dead spot over by the left side of the screen. When activating the Start menu icon took more repeated touches than necessary. I found I was using the mouse much more than the touchscreen , which isn't a good notion for a touch-oriented desktop. The ZX4352-33e has 8 USB 2.0 ports, but there aren't any advanced ports like USB 3.0 or eSATA. Six of the USB ports are under a hard-to-open door on the back of the desktop, joined by a VGA port, Ethernet, audio, and PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. The access door is a tightly-set flap of plastic that takes too much effort to open, and feels like it may break if you try to force it. The single HDMI port is occupied by the lead to the internal monitor, so it's not really usable. There are two more USB ports on the side, along with audio and a digital media card reader. The desktop comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse, which you'll likely use more than the touchscreen. A touch strip below the screen controls the ambient light brightness, screen brightness, and volume. The ambient light illuminates the work surface in front of the usergreat for low-light situations, especially when you have a roommate who turns in early. The audio is also notable because though it's THX-certified, it doesn't get very loud. It barely gets up to a level that would overcome polite conversation. At least it's distortion-free at maximum levels. The ZX4352-33e comes with the Best Buy app (online store) installed, so it doesn't have too much trialware or bloatware pre-installed. The only notable extra applications are the usual Gateway Games (Wild Tangent), Cooliris (a media browser overlay for IE), Office 2010 starter, and a short 60-day trial of Norton Internet Security. Not too bad, though I'd rather see a 12-15 month subscription to Norton included protecting against new threats. Performance The ZX4352-33e features many of the same internal components as the Gateway ZX6951-53. There's the same Intel Core i3-550 processor, 4GB of DDR3 memory, and integrated Intel HD graphics. The ZX4352-33e has a larger 1TB 7,200rpm hard drive, but only has a DVD burner to the Gateway ZX6951-53's Blu-ray drivea fair trade-off. The ZX4352-33e's i3-550 processor helped it receive great scores on the multimedia benchmark tests: 2 minutes 23 seconds on the Handbrake video encoding test, and 4:12 on our Photoshop CS5 test. It's a good system for multimedia hobbyists who don't need higher end 3D graphics, as the ZX4352-33e could only garner single-digit Crysis scores. Compared with the current Editors' Choice systems for all-in-one desktop PCs, the Gateway One ZX4351-33e comes across as a good, but not great. The HP TouchSmart 310-1000z ($1,159 direct, 4.0 stars), is a better touch-screen PC thanks to HP's third-generation TouchSmart interface; in contract, the ZX4351-33e screen's unevenness and non-touch friendly Windows preset cost it a few crucial points. The ZX4351-33e's lower price and multimedia performance would almost make it seem more attractive than the HP 310, but it's not that much faster. Our current entry-level all-in-one PC EC is the HP Omni 100 ($559.99 list, 4.5 stars), and while the ZX4351-33e is certainly a much faster desktop, the HP 100 is fast enough for day-to-day use, and costs $200 less. So the ZX4351-33e finishes somewhere in the middle: It's faster than the entry-level PCs, but its drawbacks make it less effective as a touchscreen PC than our EC winners.
