With the vast majority of laptops on store shelves priced well below $1,000, it's almost startling to come across the HP Pavilion dv7-3080us. The huge, 17.3-inch laptop, available at Staples, carries a big price: $1,449 (list). It justifies its elevated price, however, when you look at its performance. Based on a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 6GB of memory, and the Nvidia GeForce GT 230M graphics card, the Pavilion dv7-3080us is a powerhouse. It posted excellent frame rates on our 3D gaming tests, and its application performance is leaps-and-bounds better than dual-core laptops that cost a few hundred dollars less. Rounding out its attractions is a Blu-ray player, surprisingly decent audio output, and an 8-cell battery that delivers respectable battery life for a desktop replacement. Not everybody needs a hulking, multimedia laptop, but if you do I'd encourage you to look at the HP Pavilion dv7-3080us. Design The Pavilion dv7-3080us features HP's standard Pavilion ID, with an imprint design on the lid and keyboard deck, chrome edges, and all surfaces buffed to a high gloss. The chassis is a deep brown color (HP calls it Espresso) with thin, curved pinstripes running across it, which are occasionally interrupted with a round shapes that look either like bubbles or, as my colleague John Delaney classified them, crop circles. I like the look of this particular Pavilion, but overall I'm not a fan of HP's current laptop design. I think its Pavilions are over designed, with too much polish added. The glossy surfaces look nice on store shelves, but they'll be covered in fingerprints and smudges by the end of the first day of owning one. The glossy, silver-hued touchpad blends in with the rest of the laptop's design, but it does not provide good feel. Your finger drags on the shiny surface. I prefer the matte finish on the touchpad of the Dell Inspiron 1750 (2211MBU) or even the rough texture of the one on the Sony VAIO VGN-NW270F/S touchpad. Even the keyboard, which includes a dedicated number pad to its right, has a slight, glossy finish. Like the rest of the chassis, the display has a glossy coating. You'll suffer from glare and reflections when working in a brightly lit room. That said, such a display makes sense given the laptop's intended entertainment purpose. Movies and games look spectacular on the 17.3-inch, LED-backlit display. It has a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1,600 by 900 native resolution. It comes 180 horizontal lines away from being able to display 1080p HD video, but Blu-ray movies looked awesome nonetheless on the cinematic display, with vibrant color, deep black levels, and smooth movement. The laptop supplies audio to match the video output. It features a pair of Altec Lansing stereo speakers but also adds a subwoofer to the bottom of the laptop. The speakers reach an impressive volume for an integrated sound system, with crisp highs and depth in the low frequencies. At 7.5 pounds, the Pavilion dv7-3080us is of average weight for a desktop replacement. You won't want to leave the house with any 17.3-inch laptop, though the Dell 1750 (2211MBU) is nearly a pound lighter at 6.7 pounds. Features With its grand size and high price, the Pavilion dv7-3080us has the room and funds available to deliver a comprehensive set of features. And deliver it does. The laptop features HDMI and VGA video ports, four USB 2.0 ports (one of which doubles as an eSATA port), a mini-FireWire port, a multi-format media card reader, and an ExpressCard/54 slot (HP includes a tiny Media Center remote that you can store in this slot). In addition to Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n Wi-Fi connections, there's a modem jack for those still holding onto their dial-up connection. Along the front edge is a microphone jack and two headphone jacks. The optical drive can read Blu-ray discs and write to DVDs and CDs. It also features HP's LightScribe technology, which lets you laser etch images to specially coated CDs and DVDs. The 500GB hard drive isn't any larger than what you'd find in cheaper laptops, but it'll still hold plenty of photos and videos before you even begin to think about filling it up. It's also a 7,200rpm drive, which helps speed performance when compared with a 5,400rpm drive. The drive isn't cluttered with too much trialware and includes Microsoft Works, Corel PaintShop Pro Photo X2, Corel VideoStudio 12, and HP's MediaSmart suite. HP MediaSmart duplicates the function of Microsoft's Media Center app. I prefer the Media Center interface to most vendor-supplied media apps, HP's included. Performance Driving the HP Pavilion dv7-3080us's stellar performance is Intel's new mobile quad-core processor, the 1.6GHz Core i7-720QM. Dual-core laptops are simply no match for this quad-core beast. Helping the processor rip through our benchmark tests is 6GB of DDR3 memory and the Nvidia GeForce GT 230M graphics card, which shows up to the party with 1GB of its own video memory. It's not really a fair fight, but to give you an idea of what your money buys when you go from a laptop like the $729 Dell 1750 (2211MBU) that features a standard mainstream configIntel Core 2 Duo T6600 processor, 4GB of memory, and integrated graphicsto the Pavilion dv7-3080us, let's look at their benchmark scores side by side. On PCMark Vantage, the dv7-3080us's score of 6,323 was 60% faster than the Dell 1750's score of 3,949. The dv7-3080us finished the Windows Media Encoder test with a 45% faster score, while its Cinebench R10 score was more than double that of the Dell 1750. Compared with one of the only other Core i7-based laptops we've reviewed thus far, the Toshiba Qosmio X505-Q850, which featured the slightly faster 1.73GHz Core i7-820QM chip, the HP Pavilion dv7-3080us trailed just behind on the application benchmark tests, with the exception of PCMark Vantage. The dv7's added 2GB of RAM might have helped it to a small 4% advantage on that test. The Toshiba X505-Q850 featured a faster GeForce GTS 250M and as a result, enjoyed better framerates on World in Conflict. That's not to say the Pavilion dv7-3080us is a slouch when it comes to 3D gamingfar from it. It posted a very smooth 61 frames per second on Crysis at 1024 by 768 (with advanced settings turned off). With their power-hungry parts and large displays, high-end desktop replacements rarely deliver decent battery life, but the Pavilion dv7-3080us uses an 8-cell (73WHr) battery that lasted a respectable 3 hours 50 minutes on MobileMark 2007. That's more than three times as long as the Toshiba X505-Q850's 87Whr battery lasted on the same test, and nearly as long as the lower-powered Dell Inspiron 1750 (2211MBU) ran. Although its price is higher than the other laptops you'll see in Staples, the HP Pavilion dv7-3080us delivers knock-out performance and a comprehensive feature set that more than justify the cost. Consider this laptop the first step in the mobile Core i7's march to the mainstream. Also consider the Pavilion dv7-3080us if you are looking for a do-it-all desktop replacement. Only the Editors' Choice Acer Aspire AS8940-6865 is a better buy, with its incredible screen and screen resolution, an abundance of features, and outstanding performance scores for the same price.
