Here you'll find headphone and microphone jacks as well. At the very top of the front panel are four card reader slots; below them are two optical drive bays, one of which holds a DVD multi-drive (the other is vacant). A shiny Acer logo adorns the center of the panel.Costco bundles this system with a bright 23-inch Acer monitor with built-in speakers and a 1,920-by-1,080 resolution, which means it can display high-definition video and other content at 1080p (full HD). Image quality is crisp and colors are vibrant, but the panel sports a narrow viewing angle; colors lose their pop when viewed from a side angle. On the plus side, the matte anti-glare coating is non-reflective. The monitor has DVI and VGA inputs, but the AM3470 doesn't have a DVI output, so you'll have to use an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (not included) to send a digital signal to the display. The pricier\n",

It even comes with all the proper cables to connect the desktop to the monitorall but HDMI, as the system only has DVI-D and VGA video outputs onboard. Of the six additional USB ports at the rear of the case, two are USB 3.0 ports that provide transfer speeds up to ten times faster than USB 2.0. They are joined by HDMI and VGA video ports, an Ethernet port, and a Wi-Fi antenna. You'll need a screwdriver to remove the side panel to gain access to the interior but there's not much room for future expansion inside. There's an available PCIe x16 slot, but the lone PCIe x1 slot is taken up with the Wi-Fi card. If you decide to add a graphics card at a later date you'll probably have to upgrade the 300 Watt power supply. There's also room for an additional hard drive and a secondary optical drive. The AM3470-UC30P's 1TB hard drive provides plenty of storage for applications, photo albums, and audio and video files. It comes with Window 7 Home Premium and a handful of Acer utilities, including eRecovery Management data restoration software, and Clear.fi, Acer's multimedia streaming and sharing software. You also get Microsoft Office 2010 Starter Edition, Nero 10 burning software, and Zune's video and music player. As with all PCs sold at Costco, the AM3470-UC30P comes with a two-year warranty as opposed to the manufacturer's standard one-year plan.

You typically want at least 30fps for smooth game play. With the resolution set to 1,920-by-1,080 and effects set to high quality, it managed a paltry 5.9 fps. It ran our DirectX 10 Crysis test at 40fps at 1,280-by-720 resolution at Medium quality settings, but with the resolution cranked up to 1,920-by-1,080 and quality set to Very High, the AM3470-UC30P yielded unplayable results (5.29fps).
